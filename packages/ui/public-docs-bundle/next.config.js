     * Customers who opt-in for subpath routing must use rewrite rules from their hosting provider. Because of the

     * subpath does not exist in their hosting provider. Potentially, even, their root path is also a next.js app.
     * To avoid conflicting with the customer's app, or introduce complex rewrite rules for the customer, we must edit
     * the `assetPrefix` to point to an external URL that hosts all static assets (which we call the CDN_URI).
     * On prod, the CDN_URI is currently https://app.buildwithfern.com.
     *
     * Note that local development should not set the CDN_URI to ensure that the assets are served from the local server.
