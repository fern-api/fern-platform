Visualize data using Athena Notebooks SidebarOnce you have an SQL output, you can harness the power and flexibility of visualisations or further analysis using Python. In Athena Notebooks, you can click "Chat" in the top right corner to ask Athena for help writing code for visualizations you need. Copy and paste a dataframe headers and 2-3 rows to give Athena all needed context.

Write code to visualize this table:
route_id 	route_source 	route_destination 	passenger_id 	customer_name 	total_tickets
0 	1 	West Sylvia 	Williamsshire 	816 	Jaruwan Rogers 	13
1 	1 	West Sylvia 	Williamsshire 	679 	Karen Tapp 	9


Sure, here's the code:
...

Copy & run the code in the notebook.import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame
# Ensure your DataFrame is named 'df' or adjust the variable name accordingly

# Visualization 1: Total Tickets Sold by Route
route_tickets_sum = df.groupby('route_id')['total_tickets'].sum().reset_index()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(route_tickets_sum['route_id'], route_tickets_sum['total_tickets'], color='deepskyblue')  # Changed color to 'deepskyblue'
plt.title('Total Tickets Sold by Route')

Visualize data using Athena Notebooks SidebarOnce you have an SQL output, you can harness the power and flexibility of visualisations or further analysis using Python. In Athena Notebooks, you can click "Chat" in the top right corner to ask Athena for help writing code for visualizations you need. Copy and paste a dataframe headers and 2-3 rows to give Athena all needed context.

Write code to visualize this table:
route_id 	route_source 	route_destination 	passenger_id 	customer_name 	total_tickets
0 	1 	West Sylvia 	Williamsshire 	816 	Jaruwan Rogers 	13
1 	1 	West Sylvia 	Williamsshire 	679 	Karen Tapp 	9


Sure, here's the code:
...

Copy & run the code in the notebook.import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame
# Ensure your DataFrame is named 'df' or adjust the variable name accordingly

# Visualization 1: Total Tickets Sold by Route
route_tickets_sum = df.groupby('route_id')['total_tickets'].sum().reset_index()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(route_tickets_sum['route_id'], route_tickets_sum['total_tickets'], color='deepskyblue')  # Changed color to 'deepskyblue'
plt.title('Total Tickets Sold by Route')
plt.xlabel('Route ID')
plt.ylabel('Total Tickets Sold')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

**Task:** Generate comprehensive documentation for a dataset.

**Objective:**
Create output template documentation for a table, detailing its schema, fields, and relevant metadata. The documentation should follow the structure provided below and adhere to the specified markdown format and tone. Use metadata and other available information to produce the documentation tailored to the context. This documentation will serve as a guide for understanding the dataset's structure, purpose, and usage within the organization. It should be clear, concise, and informative, catering to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Instructions:**
1. Explore information available on the dataset {dataset_name}:
- dataset metadata: 

{dataset_schema_details}


2. For each section of the documentation, provide clear, concise information as outlined in the output template. Use professional language and ensure the documentation is accessible to a broad audience.
3. Include a brief example value or description where requested to illustrate the type of content expected.
4. Only include factual statements. When making assumptions or inferences, clearly label them as such.

Load a JSON-serialisable data frame
Call tools.data_frame() to load a data frame from a CSV/excel file:
df = athena.tools.data_frame(
    document_id='doc_9249292-d118-42d3-95b4-00eccfe0754f'
)
df

Athena returns a simple pandas DataFrame representation with the default parsing options. You can adjust the following options:

row_limit: int number of rows to load,
index_column: int column to use as an index,
columns: list[str | int] indices or names of columns to include,
sheet_name: str | int name of the sheet to load, only applicable to Excel files
separator: str separator to use when parsing, only applicable to CSV files

For example, when working with large datasets, it might be beneficial to first examine at the initial five rows:
df_head = athena.tools.data_frame(
    document_id='doc_9249292-d118-42d3-95b4-00eccfe0754f',
    row_limit=5
)
df_head

Load a large or complex data frame
The tools.data_frame() method is sufficient for handling well-formatted,
medium-sized data frames and provides interface that is agnostic to the SDK version
(a sister method is available in the TypeScript SDK).
However, if your Excel files include values that cannot be JSON-serialized,
are serializable with a loss of precision, or contain additional metadata,
you may prefer to use tools.read_data_frame() method.
This method skips the JSON serialization step and provides a raw byte stream
to the pandas read_csv or read_excel methods, as appropriate.
The keyword arguments provided to read_data_frame will be passed to
the underlying read_csv/read_excel, depending on the file type.
df_head = athena.tools.read_data_frame(
    document_id='doc_9249292-d118-42d3-95b4-00eccfe0754f',
    dtype={"a": np.float64, "b": np.int32}
)
df_head

Load a data frame with another package
If you prefer to use another data frame implementation, you can access the
raw bytes stream object using the tools.get_file() method, which accepts
a single argument - the document identifier. The resulting object complies
with the io.BytesIO interface and can be used with most data frame libraries,
for example:
import polars as pl

bytes_io = athena.tools.get_file(
    document_id='doc_9249292-d118-42d3-95b4-00eccfe0754f',
)
df = pl.read_csv(bytes_io)

Upload a file
To upload a file using the Athena SDK, you can use the upload.upload_documents() method. This method accepts a list of file tuples, where each tuple contains the filename, file content as a BytesIO object, and the MIME type.
Here's an example of how to upload an Excel file:
async def upload_file():
    # Prepare the file for upload
    file_bytes = io.BytesIO()
    with open("your_file.xlsx", "rb") as f:
        file_bytes.write(f.read())
        file_bytes.seek(0)  # Reset the cursor of the BytesIO object

    # Create the file tuple
    file_tuple = (
        "your_file.xlsx",
        file_bytes,
        "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"
    )

    # Upload the file
    result = await athena.upload.upload_documents(files=[file_tuple])
    print(result)

# Run the async function
await upload_file()

In this example:

We open the file and read its contents into a BytesIO object.
We create a tuple containing the filename, the BytesIO object, and the MIME type.
We call athena.upload.upload_documents() with a list containing our file tuple.
The function returns the result of the upload operation.

Upload multiple files
You can upload multiple files in a single request by adding more file tuples to the list:
async def upload_multiple_files():
    files = [
        ("file1.xlsx", file1_bytes, "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"),
        ("file2.csv", file2_bytes, "text/csv"),
        ("file3.pdf", file3_bytes, "application/pdf")
    ]

    result = await athena.upload.upload_documents(files=files)
    print(result)

await upload_multiple_files()

Using with FastAPI
If you're using FastAPI and want to upload files received from a client, you can use the UploadFile object:
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile):
    file_tuple = (file.filename, file.file, file.content_type)
    result = await athena.upload.upload_documents(files=[file_tuple])
    return {"message": "File uploaded successfully", "result": result}

This endpoint will accept file uploads and forward them to the Athena API using the SDK.
