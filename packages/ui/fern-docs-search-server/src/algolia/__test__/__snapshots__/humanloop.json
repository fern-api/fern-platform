There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.\n\nDeveloping, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:\n\n- **Subject matter experts matter more than ever.** As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.\n- **AI output is often non-deterministic.** Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.\n- **AI outputs are subjective**. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.\n\n<Frame caption=\"Bad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch\">\n\n![Bad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch](file:602d58f3-1208-4fa3-bc95-c307d9108bd6)\n\n</Frame>\n\nMany companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and engineers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets.

The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.\n\n<img src=\"file:b9ed95cc-edc2-4c49-b8d3-4f164a083123\" />\n\nClick the “**+ Message**” button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.\n\n<img src=\"file:5d7dd0e4-73f6-41b9-ad2b-60ba9f349f26\" />\n\nAdd the following templated message to the chat template.\n\n```\nYou are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.\n```\n\nThis message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called `topic` (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.\n\nOn the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the **Inputs** section for `topic`.\n\n1. Add a value for `topic` e.g. music, jogging, whatever\n2. Click **Run** in the bottom right of the page\n\nThis will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is _very_ funny.\n\nYou now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.\n\n### Commit your first version of this Prompt\n\n1. Click the **Commit** button\n2. Put “initial version” in the commit message field\n3. Click **Commit**\n\n<img src=\"file:386f75eb-c97a-4923-9823-168a14848719\" />\n\n### View the logs\n\nUnder the Prompt File, click ‘Logs’ to view all the generations from this Prompt\n\nClick on a row to see the details of what version of the prompt generated it. From here you can give feedback to that generation, see performance metrics, open up this example in the Editor, or add this log to a dataset.\n\n<img src=\"file:f2b286b8-7fcf-4323-9308-6ca5fbc22e44\" />\n\n</Steps>",

Each change in any of the following properties creates a new version of the Prompt:\n\n- the template such as `Write a song about {{topic}}`. For chat models, your template will contain an array of messages.\n- the model e.g. `gpt-4o`\n- all the parameters to the model such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p` etc.\n- any tools available to the model\n\nA Prompt is callable in that if you supply the necessary inputs, it will return a response from the model.\n\nInputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. `{{topic}}` and the value of the variable will need to be supplied when you call the Prompt to create a generation.\n\nThis separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different configurations and evaluate any changes.\nThe Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data in [Logs](./logs), which can then be used to create Datasets for evaluation purposes.\n\n<Callout>\n  Note that we use a capitalized \"[Prompt](/docs/concepts/prompts)\" to refer to\n  the entity in Humanloop, and a lowercase \"prompt\" to refer to the general\n  concept of input to the model.\n</Callout>\n\n<Frame caption=\"An example Prompt, serialized as a Promptfile\">\n\n```jsx\n---\nmodel: gpt-4\ntemperature: 1.0\nmax_tokens: -1\nprovider: openai\nendpoint: chat\n---\n<system>\n  Write a song about {{topic}}\n</system>\n```\n\n</Frame>"

You can think of a Dataset as a collection of testcases for your AI applications. Each testcase is represented by a **Datapoint**, which contains the following fields:\n\n- **Inputs**: a collection of prompt variable values which are interpolated into the prompt template at generation time (i.e. they replace the `{{ variables }}` you define in your prompt template).\n- **Messages**: for chat models, as well as the prompt template, you can optionally have a history of chat messages that are fed into amodel when generating a response.\n- **Target**: certain types of test cases can benefit from comparing the out your application to an expected or desired behaviour. In the simplest case, this can simply be a string representing the exact output you hope the model produces for the inputs and messages represented by the Datapoint.\n  In more complex cases, you can define an arbitrary JSON object for `target` with whatever fields are necessary to help you specify the intended behaviour.\n  <br />\n\n<img src=\"file:1774cdcd-21e8-4b64-bd06-3f9be9d99440\" />"

Click ‘**+ New**’ and create a **Prompt**.\n\n<img src=\"file:ad732e1d-77a8-4576-9933-1db6f9d9d28f\" />\n\nIn the sidebar, rename this file to \"Comedian Bot\" now or later.\n\n### Create the Prompt template in the Editor\n\nThe left hand side of the screen defines your Prompt – the parameters such as model, temperature and template. The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.\n\n<img src=\"file:b9ed95cc-edc2-4c49-b8d3-4f164a083123\" />\n\nClick the \"**+ Message**\" button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.\n\n<img src=\"file:5d7dd0e4-73f6-41b9-ad2b-60ba9f349f26\" />\n\nAdd the following templated message to the chat template.\n\n```\nYou are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.\n```\n\nThis message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called `topic` (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.\n\nOn the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the **Inputs** section for `topic`.\n\n1. Add a value for`topic` e.g. music, jogging, whatever.\n2. Click **Run** in the bottom right of the page.\n\nThis will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is _very_ funny.\n\nYou now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.\n\n### Commit your first version of this Prompt\n\n1. Click the **Commit** button\n2. Put “initial version” in the commit message field\n3. Click **Commit**\n\n<img src=\"file:386f75eb-c97a-4923-9823-168a14848719\" />\n\n### View the logs\n\nUnder the Prompt File click ‘Logs’ to view all the generations from this Prompt\n\nClick on a row to see the details of what version of the prompt generated it. From here you can give feedback to that generation, see performance metrics, open up this example in the Editor, or add this log to a dataset.\n\n<img src=\"file:f2b286b8-7fcf-4323-9308-6ca5fbc22e44\" />\n\n</Steps>\n\n---",

This is the same as [calling a Prompt](/docs/development/guides/call-prompt) but instead of using a version of the Prompt that is defined in Humanloop, you're setting the template and parameters directly in code.\n\nThe benefits of using the Humanloop proxy are:\n\n- consistent interface across different AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and more – see [the full list of supported models](/docs/v5/reference/supported-models)\n- all your requests are logged automatically\n- creates versions of your Prompts automatically, so you can track performance over time\n- can call multiple providers while managing API keys centrally (you can also supply keys at runtime)\n\nIn this guide, we'll cover how to call LLMs using the Humanloop proxy."

You will only need to supply prompt ID and the inputs needed by the prompt template, and the endpoint will handle fetching the latest template, making the LLM call and logging the result.\n\nHowever, there may be scenarios that you wish to manage the LLM provider calls directly in your own code instead of relying on Humanloop. For example, you may be using an LLM provider that is not directly supported by Humanloop such as a custom self-hosted model, or you may want to avoid adding Humanloop to the critical path of the LLM API calls."

    "content": "To create and use a tool follow the following steps:\n\n<Steps>\n### **Open the editor**\nGo to a Prompt and open the Editor.\n\n### **Select a model that supports Tool Calling**\n\n<Info title=\"Models supporting Tool Calling\">\n  To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the [Models\n  page](/docs/reference/supported-models#models).\n</Info>\n\n\nIn the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose a model like `gpt-4o` which supports Tool Calling.\n\n### **Define the Tool**\n\nTo get started with tool definition, it's recommended to begin with one of our preloaded example tools. For this guide, we'll use the `get_current_weather` tool. Select this from the dropdown menu of preloaded examples.\n\nIf you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal [JSON Schema syntax](https://json-schema.org/). When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.\n\n<img src=\"file:0d148432-70f4-4c8b-91aa-23d2854e8331\" />\n\n### **Test it out**\n\nNow, let's test our tool by inputting a relevant query. Since we're working with a weather-related tool, try typing: `What's the weather in Boston?`. This should prompt OpenAI to respond using the parameters we've defined.\n\n<Tip title=\"Tool calling is context-sensitive\">\n\nKeep in mind that the model's use of the tool depends on the relevance of the user's input. For instance, a question like '_how are you today?_' is unlikely to trigger a weather-related tool response.\n\n</Tip>\n\n### **Check assistant response for a tool call**\n\nUpon successful setup, the assistant should respond by invoking the tool, providing both the tool's name and the required data. For our `get_current_weather` tool, the response might look like this:\n\n```\nget_current_weather({\n  \"location\": \"London\"\n})\n```\n\n### **Input tool response**\n\nAfter the tool call, the editor will automatically add a partially filled tool message for you to complete.\n\nYou can paste in the exact response that the Tool would respond with. For prototyping purposes, you can also just simulate the repsonse yourself (LLMs can handle it!). Provide in a mock response:\n\nTo input the tool response:\n\n1. Find the tool response field in the editor.\n2. Enter theresponse matching the expected format, such as:\n   ```json\n   { \"temperature\": 12, \"condition\": \"drizzle\", \"unit\": \"celsius\" }\n   ```\n\nRemember, the goal is to simulate the tool's output as if it were actually fetching real-time weather data. This allows you to test and refine your prompt and tool interaction without needing to implement the actual weather API.\n\n### **Submit tool response**\n\nAfter entering the simulated tool response, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to the AI model.\n\n### **Review assistant response**\n\nThe assistant should now respond using the information provided in your simulated tool response. For example, if you input that the weather in London was drizzling at 12°C, the assistant might say:\n\n`Based on the current weather data, it's drizzling in London with a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius.`\n\nThis response demonstrates how the AI model incorporates the tool's output into its reply, providing a more contextual and data-driven answer.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:638fd12b-40d5-4e3a-845a-ad4a6c767438\"\n  alt=\"Example of assistant response using tool data\"\n/>\n\n### **Iterate and refine**\n\nFeel free to experiment with different queries and simulated tool responses. This iterative process helps you fine-tune your prompt and understand how the AI model interacts with the tool, ultimately leading to more effective and accurate responses in your application.\n\n### **Save your Prompt**\n\nBy saving your prompt, you're creating a new version that includes the tool configuration.\n\n</Steps>\n\nCongratulations! You've successfully learned how to use tool calling in the Humanloop editor. This powerful feature allows you to simulate and test tool interactions, helping you create more dynamic and context-aware AI applications.\n\nKeep experimenting with different scenarios and tool responses to fully explore the capabilities of your AI model and create even more impressive applications!",

A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\n\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\n\nInstead of needing to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited, you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool."

Please contact us if you wish\n  to learn more about our [Enterprise plan](https://humanloop.com/pricing)\n</Note>\n\n\nTo create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:\n\n<Steps>\n\n### Create a new Snippet Tool\n\n<img src=\"file:0f219e42-6935-4dbc-8689-265738570928\" />\n\n### Name the Tool\n\nName it `assistant-personalities` and give it a description `Useful assistant personalities`.\n\n### Add a key called \"helpful-assistant\"\n\nIn the initial box add `helpful-assistant` and give it a value of `You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.`\n\n### Add another key called \"grumpy-assistant\"\n\nLet's add another key-value pair, so press the **Add a key/value pair** button and add a new key of `grumpy-assistant` and give it a value of `You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy.`.\n\n<img src=\"file:0297c12d-7572-4b93-8204-d9553cfc7afe\" />\n\n### Press **Create Tool**.\n\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.\n\n### Navigate to the **Editor**\n\nGo to the Editor of your previously created project.\n\n### Add `{{ assistant-personalities(key) }}` to your prompt\n\nDelete the existing prompt template and add `{{ assistant-personalities(key) }}` to your prompt.\n\n<Note title=\"Tool syntax: {{ tool-name(key) }}\">\nDouble curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. `{{ my-tool-name(key) }}`.\n\n</Note>\n\n### Enter the key as an input\n\nIn the input area set the value to `helpful-assistant`. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your `key`.\n\n### Press the **Run** button\n\nStart the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.\n\n<img src=\"file:52c5db5b-1863-41e9-a5da-f86b9219505b\" />\n\n### Change the key to `grumpy-assistant`.\n\n<Warning title=\"The snippet will only render (or update) in the preview after running the chat\">\n  If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to\n  first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\n</Warning>\n\n### Play with the LLM\n\nAsk the LLM, `I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'`. You should see a grumpy response from \"Freddy\" now.\n\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: `{{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}`, so in this case it would be `{{ assistant-personalities(\"grumpy-assistant\") }}`. Delete the `grumpy-assistant` field and add it into your chat template.\n\n### **Save** your Prompt.\n\nIf you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.\n\n</Steps>\n\n<img src=\"file:79b12d9b-b906-4b77-9ae3-6e49da4ba952\" />\n\nThe Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the Prompts when you update them, as long as the key is the same.\n\n<Warning title=\"Changing a snippet value can change a Prompt's behaviour\">\nSince the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing\nthe values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools can affect the Prompt's\nbehaviour in way that won't be captured by the Prompt's version.\n\nThis could be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the\nchanges are expected.\n\n</Warning>",

    "content": "To create a reusable JSON Schema tool for your organization, follow these steps:\n\n<Steps>\n### Create a new Tool file\n\nNavigate to the homepage or sidebar and click the 'New File' button.\n\n### Choose the JSON Schema Tool type\n\nFrom the available options, select **Json Schema** as the Tool type.\n\n### Define your tool's structure\n\nPaste the following JSON into the provided dialog to define your tool's structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n  \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Location\",\n        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n      },\n      \"unit\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Unit\",\n        \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal [JSON Schema syntax](https://json-schema.org/). When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.\n\n### Commit this version of the Tool\n\nPress the **Commit** button to commit this version of the Tool, and set it as the default version by deploying it.\n\n### Navigate to the **Editor** of a Prompt\n\nSwitch to a model that supports tool calling, such as `gpt-4o`.\n\n<Info title=\"Models supporting Tool Calling\">\n  To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the [Models\n  page](/docs/reference/supported-models#models).\n</Info>\n\n\n### **Add Tool** to the Prompt definition.\n\n### Select 'Link existing Tool'\n\nIn the dropdown, go to the **Link existing tool** option. You should see your `get_current_weather` tool, click on it to link it to your editor.\n\n<img src=\"file:82b8db60-27bd-4436-bb3c-8f1da79407e9\" />\n\n### Test that the Prompt is working with the tool\n\nNow that your Tool is linked you can start using it. In the **Chat** section, in the **User** input, enter `\"what is the weather in london?\"`\n\nPress the **Run** button.\n\nYou should see the **Assistant** respond with the tool response and a new **Tool** field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in `22` into the tool response and press **Run**.\n\n<img src=\"file:1835f4ab-748e-4a64-8764-f69adb82d602\" />\n\nThe model will respond with `The current weather in London is 22 degrees`.\n\n### Commit the Prompt\n\nYou've linked a Tool to your Prompt, now let's save it. Press the **Save** button and name your Prompt `weather-model-config`.\n\n### (Optional) Update the Tool\n\nNow that's we've linked your `get_current_weather` tool to your Prompt, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved `weather-model-config` config. Navigate back to the Tool in the sidebar and go to the Editor.\n\n### Update the Tool\n\nLet's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to `get_current_weather_updated` and for the required fields, add `unit` as a required field. The should look like this now:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_weather_updated\",\n  \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Location\",\n        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n      },\n      \"unit\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Unit\",\n        \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\", \"unit\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Commit and deploy the Tool\n\nPress the **Commmmit** button and then follow the steps to deloy this version of the Tool.\n\nYour Tool is now updated.\n\n### Try the Prompt again\n\nNavigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the `weather-model-config` loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says `get_current_weather_updated`.\n\nIn the Chat section enter in again, `What is the weather in london?`, and press **Run** again.\n\n### Check the response\n\nYou should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the `unit` field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your Prompt.\n\n</Steps>\n\n<img src=\"file:d564f7b0-6b6c-4c89-b1ee-fab1311b93a1\" />\n\n<Warning title=\"Linked JSON Schema tool changes propagate to Prompt\">\n  When updating your Tool, remember that the change will affect all the Prompts\n  that link to it.

You can include as many columns as you have variables in your Prompt template.\n   - There is additionally a column called `target` which will populate the target output for the classifier Prompt. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.\n   - More complex Datapoints that contain `messages` and structured objects for targets are suppoerted, but are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be hard-to-read JSON. If you need more complex Datapoints, [use the API](#upload-via-api) instead.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:cc2597ba-c565-48a2-b56e-527aef4a8e27\"\n  alt=\"A CSV file in Google Sheets defining query and taget pairs for our Classifier Prompt.\"\n/>\n\n### Export the Google Sheet to CSV\n\nIn Google sheets, choose **File** → **Download** → **Comma-separated values (.csv)**\n\n### Create a new Dataset File\n\nOn Humanloop, select *New* at the bottom of the left hand sidebar, then select *Dataset*.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:c4f43d75-dc17-4b2a-a99e-5f16d348bea4\"\n  alt=\"Creat a new File from the sidebar on Humanloop.\"\n/>\n\n\n### Click **Upload CSV**\n\nFirst name your dataset when prompted in the sidebar, then select the **Upload CSV** button and drag and drop the CSV file you created above using the file explorer.\nYou will then be prompted to provide a commit message to describe the initial state of the dataset.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:7bb8f7ee-d389-428a-81f1-a27e21229230\"\n  alt=\"Uploading a CSV file to create a dataset.\"\n/>\n\n### Follow the link in the pop-up to inspect the Dataset created\n\nYou'll see the input-output pairs that were included in the CSV file and you can the rows to inspect and edit the individual Datapoints.\n\n<img src=\"file:c36420f6-a8a5-4fc3-b97a-fc047662f3e0\"\n  alt=\"Inspect the Dataset created from the CSV file.\"\n/>\n\n</Steps>",

By default, **Cost**, **Tokens** and **Latency** Evaluators are pre-selected.\n\n<Info title={\"Log Caching\"}>\nBy default the system will re-use Logs if they exist for the chosen Dataset, Prompts and Evaluators. This makes it easy to extend reports without paying the cost of re-running your Prompts and Evaluators.\n\nIf you want to force the system to re-run the Prompts against the Dataset producing a new batch of Logs, you can select the **Manage** button in the setup panel and choose **+New Batch**.\n\n</Info>\n\n- Select **Save** to trigger the Evaluation report. You will see the report below the setup panel populate with a progress bar and status pending as the Logs are generated on Humanloop.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:8cd034a4-fbbf-4e9e-bc46-7ce52bacd5b1\"\n  alt=\"In progress Evaluation report\"\n/>\n\n<Tip title={\"Using your Runtime\"}>\n  This guide assumes both the Prompt and Evaluator Logs are generated using the\n  Humanloop runtime. For certain use cases where more flexibility is required,\n  the runtime for producing Logs instead lives in your code - see our guide on\n  [Logging](../../development/guides/logging), which also works with our\n  Evaluations feature. We have a guide for how to run Evaluations with Logs\n  generated in your code coming soon!\n</Tip>\n\n### Review the results\n\nIt will generally take at least a couple of minutes before the Evaluation report is marked as **completed** as the system generates all the required Prompt and Evaluator Logs.\n\nOnce the report is completed, you can review the performance of the different Prompt versions using the Evaluators you selected.\n\n- The top spider plot provides you with a summary of the average Evaluator performance across all the Prompt versions.\n  In our case, `gpt-4o`, although on average slightly slower and more expensive on average, is significantly better when it comes to **User Satisfaction**.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:22744b0c-8515-466d-bcb6-8e2c7c7ee27c\"\n  alt=\"Evaluation Spider plot\"\n/>\n\n- Below the spider plot, you can see the breakdown of performance per Evaluator.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:4d09e21e-48b1-4820-b097-61e1c7c45c9d\"\n  alt=\"Evaluation Evaluator stats breakdown\"\n/>\n\n- To drill into and debug the Logs that were generated, select the **Logs** button top right of the Evaluation report.\n  This brings you to the Evaluation Logs table and you can filter and review logs to understand the performance better and replay Logs in our Prompt Editor.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:fe77e299-07f3-4e6f-8c85-d231e64e31eb\"\n  alt=\"Drill down to Evaluatoin Logs.\"\n/>\n\n</Steps>",

Our editor lets you create prompts that pass log data to a model for assessment. This is ideal for subjective evaluations like tone and factual accuracy.

For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.\n2. **Implicit feedback**: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).\n3. **Free-form feedback**: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.\n\nYou should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.\nFor example, a Human Evaluator with return type \"text\" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type \"multi_select\" can be used to capture user actions\nthat provide implicit feedback.\n\nIf you have not done so, you can follow our guide to [create a Human Evaluator](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluator) to set up the appropriate feedback schema.\n\n</Note>"

Fake News media pushing ALIEN conspiracy theories. SAD! \"\n    + \"I know Area 51, have the best aliens. Roswell? Total hoax! Believe me. 👽🚫 #Roswell #FakeNews\",\n)\n```\n\nIf the user removes their feedback (e.g. if the user deselects a previous 👎 feedback), you can record this by passing `judgment=None`.\n\n```python\nremoved_rating_log = client.evaluators.log(\n    parent_id=log_id,\n    path=\"rating\",\n    judgment=None,\n)\n```\n\n</Accordion>\n\n</Steps>",

This release focuses on improving the code-first workflows for evaluating more complex AI applications like RAG and Agent-based apps.\n\nFlows allow you to version your whole AI application on Humanloop (as opposed to just individual Prompts and Tools) and allows you to log and evaluate the full trace of the important processing steps that occur when running your app. \n\nSee our [cookbook tutorial](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/rag/evaluate-rag-flow.ipynb) for examples on how to use Flows in your code. \n\n\n![Image of a Flow with logs](file:6c836381-036b-456b-941f-ae95219dc64d)\n\n### What's next\n\nWe'll soon be extending support for allowing Evaluators to access all Logs inside a trace. \nAdditionally, we will build on this by adding UI-first visualisations and management of your Flows.\n\nWe'll sunset Sessions in favour of Flows in the near future. Reach out to us for guidance on how to migrate your Session-based workflows to Flows.\n\n",

This means you can draft a version of a Prompt in the editor and simultaneously evaluate it in the evaluations tab, speeding up your iteration cycle.\n\nThis is a global change that allows you to load and use uncommitted versions. Uncommitted versions are created automatically when a new version of a Prompt, Tool, or Evaluator is run in their respective editors or called via the API. These versions will now appear in the version pickers underneath all your committed versions.\n\nTo evaluate an uncommitted version, simply select it by using the hash (known as the \"version id\") when setting up your evaluation.\n\n![Uncommitted versions in the version picker](file:bccddb71-a5a3-4222-91be-d4e063a71dad)\n",

    "content": "## Human Evaluator upgrades\n\nWe've made significant upgrades to Human Evaluators and related workflows to improve your ability to gather Human judgments (sometimes referred to as \"feedback\") in assessing the quality of your AI applications.\n\nHere are some of the key improvements:\n\n- Instead of having to define a limited feedback schema tied to the settings of a specific Prompt, you can now **define your schema with a Human Evaluator file and reuse it across multiple Prompts and Tools** for both monitoring and offline evaluation purposes.\n- You are no longer restricted to the default types of `Rating`, `Actions` and `Issues` when defining your feedback schemas from the UI. We've introduced a **more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types** and valence controls.\n- We've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now **also be used with Tools and other Evaluators** (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.\n- We've **improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback** to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.\n\nTo set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on **Evaluator**, then click on **Human**.\nThis will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a `Return type` for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.\n\n![Tone evaluator set up with options and instructions](file:9c477a6f-8107-4320-8cd9-ff101f262b7a)\n\nYou can then reference this Human Evaluator within the `Monitoring` dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their `Evaluations` tab.\n\nWe've set up default `Rating` and `Correction` Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing. We've migrated all your existing Prompt specific feedback schemas to Human Evaluator files and these will continue to work as before with no disruption.\n\nCheck out our updated document for further details on how to use Human Evaluators:\n\n- [Create a Human Evaluator](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluator)\n- [Capture End User Feedback](/docs/observability/guides/capture-user-feedback)\n- [Run a Human Evaluation](/docs/evaluation/guides/run-human-evaluation)\n",

You can now clearly see what the results are for each of the connected Evaluators.\n\nThis means that it's now easier to debug the judgments applied to a Log, and if necessary, re-run code/AI Evaluators in-line.\n\n![Log drawer's Evaluation tab with the \"Run again\" menu open](file:96373200-4779-425c-a95f-ee79c26fe5d6)\n\n### Ability to re-run Evaluators\n\nWe have introduced the ability to re-run your Evaluators against a specific Log. This feature allows you to more easily address and fix issues with previous Evaluator judgments for specific Logs.\n\nYou can request a re-run of that Evaluator by opening the menu next to that Evaluator and pressing the \"Run Again\" option.\n\n### Evaluation popover\n\nIf you hover over an evaluation result, you'll now see a popover with more details about the evaluation including any intermediate results or console logs without context switching.\n\n![Evaluation popover](file:46f3ec14-9cc8-479e-bd9f-bdd3a44ee812)\n\n### Updated Evaluator Logs table\n\nThe Logs table for Evaluators now supports the functionality as you would expect from our other Logs tables.

There are two ways to trigger Structured Outputs in the API:\n\n1. **Tool Calling:** When defining a tool as part of your Prompt definition, you can now include a `strict=true` flag. The model will then output JSON data that adheres to the tool `parameters` schema definition.\n\n```python\n\"\"\" Example using our v5 API. \"\"\"\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nclient = Humanloop(\n    api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n)\n\nclient.prompts.call(\n    path=\"person-extractor\",\n    prompt={\n        \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n        \"template\": [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n                \"content\": \"You are an information extractor.\",\n            },\n        ],\n        \"tools\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"extract_person_object\",\n                \"description\": \"Extracts a person object from a user message.\",\n                # New parameter to enable structured outputs\n                \"strict\": True,\n                \"parameters\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"name\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"name\": \"Full name\",\n                            \"description\": \"Full name of the person\",\n                        },\n                        \"address\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"name\": \"Full address\",\n                            \"description\": \"Full address of the person\",\n                        },\n                        \"job\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                            \"name\": \"Job\",\n                            \"description\": \"The job of the person\",\n                        }\n                    },\n                    # These fields need to be defined in strict mode\n                    \"required\": [\"name\", \"address\", \"job\"],\n                    \"additionalProperties\": False,\n                },\n            }\n        ],\n    },\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"Hey!

All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.\n\n<img src=\"file:797798fa-e858-42e8-8501-702fdc59d669\" />\n\n### Feature breakdown\n\nWe've introduced a new **stats comparison view**, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.\n\nThe performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.\n\nEvaluation reports also introduce an **automatic deduplication** feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a **New Batch** in the setup panel.\n\n<img src=\"file:95966922-6d64-4e7f-80a7-06c93228420d\" />\n\n### How to use Evaluation reports\n\nTo get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click **Evaluate** in the top right.\n\nThis will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.\n\n![](file:fc069caf-4584-43a9-abc9-60742b492f0a)\n\nWhen you click **Save**, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.\n\n### What's next\n\nWe're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations.\n",

More details are available in its [release announcement](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/).\n\n## Additional Replicate models support via API\n\nThrough the Replicate model provider additional open models can be used by specifying a model name via the API. The model name should be of a similar form as the ref used when calling `replicate.run(ref)` using [Replicate's Python SDK](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python).\n\nFor example, Vicuna, an open-source chatbot model based on finetuning LLaMA can be used with the following model name alongside `provider: \"replicate\"` in your Prompt version.  \n`replicate/vicuna-13b:6282abe6a492de4145d7bb601023762212f9ddbbe78278bd6771c8b3b2f2a13b`\n",

Read more about the release [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family).\n\nThe release contains three models in ascending order of capability: _Haiku_, _Sonnet_, and _Opus_. This suite provides users with the different options to balance intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific use-cases.\n\n<img src=\"file:e71bc26c-7a15-4f75-afb6-bca5f8f1022c\" />\n\n\n## **Key take aways**\n\n1. **Performance** - a new leader. The largest of the 3 models, Opus, is claimed to outperform GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on key benchmarks such as MMLU and Hellaswag. It even reached 84.9% on the Humaneval coding test set (vs GPT-4’s 67%) 🤯\n2. **200k context window** with near-perfect recall on selected benchmarks. Opus reports 99% accuracy on the NIAH test, which measures how accurately a model can recall information given to it in a large corpus of data.\n3. **Opus has vision**. Anthropic claim that performance here is on par with that of other leading models (ie GPT-4 and Gemini). They say it’s most useful for inputting graphs, slides etc. in an enterprise setting.\n4. **Pricing** - as compared to OpenAI:\n\nOpus - $75 (2.5x GPT-4 Turbo)  \nSonnet - $15 (50% of GPT-4 Turbo)  \nHaiku - $1.25 (1.6x GPT-3.5)\n\n5. **How you can use it**: The Claude 3 family is now available on Humanloop. Bring your API key to test, evaluate and deploy the publicly available models - Opus and Sonnet.\n",

    "content": "## New Tool creation flow\n\nYou can now create Tools in the same way as you create Prompts and Directories. This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones. \n\n![](file:938abbba-c26b-43d0-b511-5f58520098cc)\n\nTo create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.\n\n## Tool editor and deployments\nYou can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.\n\n![](file:e2489aa7-ca61-4555-809c-80c1f7e1803e)\n\n### Tool Editor\n\nThis replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions. \n\n![](file:1de72ff7-e6c5-4eb5-892a-977bbed692bf)\n\n### Deployment\n\nTools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.\n\nAnd example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature `snippet(key)` with a key/value pair of \"_helpful_\"/\"_You are a helpful assistant_\". You decide you would rather change the value to say \"_You are a funny assistant_\", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.\n\n## Prompt labels and hover cards\n\nWe've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.\n\n<img src=\"file:08556665-8f0e-4a81-a5d5-8494053a26d3\" alt=\"Label and hover card for a deployed Prompt Version\" />\n\n\nThe labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.\n\nYou'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.\n\n<img src=\"file:595a3578-a497-450e-950e-dbef23fb0c64\" alt=\"The Prompt Version label and hover card in a Prompt Editor\" />\n\n\nAs a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black. \n\n<img src=\"file:c518da50-806c-46d9-adaa-7e01ed4c19cf\" alt=\"A Prompt Version that has not been deployed\" />\n\n## Committing Prompt Versions\n\nBuilding on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI. \n\nThis is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.\n\nIn addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use `commits` that can take `commit messages`, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts. \n\nWe've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.  \n\n<img src=\"file:4e590a72-bc55-4bb8-9dec-795e42bfe4af\" />\n\n\nWe'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks. \n\nLet us know if you have any questions around these changes!\n",

    "content": "## Control logging level\n\nWe've added a `save` flag to all of our endpoints that generate logs on Humanloop so that you can control whether the request and response payloads that may contain sensitive information are persisted on our servers or not.\n\nIf `save` is set to `false` then no `inputs`, `messages` our `outputs` of any kind (including the raw provider request and responses) are stored on our servers. This can be helpful for sensitive use cases where you can't for example risk PII leaving your system.\n\nDetails of the model configuration and any metadata you send are still stored. Therefore you can still benefit from certain types of evaluators such as human feedback, latency and cost, as well as still track important metadata over time that may not contain sensitive information.\n\nThis includes all our [chat](/api-reference/chats/create) and [completion](/api-reference/completions/create) endpoint variations, as well as our explicit [log](/api-reference/logs/log) endpoint.\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\n# You need to initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys\nhumanloop = Humanloop(api_key=\"<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>\")\n\n# humanloop.complete_deployed(...) will call the active model config on your project.\n# You can optionally set the save flag to False\ncomplete_response = humanloop.complete_deployed(\n  \tsave=False,\n    project=\"<YOUR UNIQUE PROJECT NAME>\",\n    inputs={\"question\": \"I have inquiry about by life insurance policy.

It can also effective for helping to troubleshoot the cases where we return well handled provider errors from our API.\n\n<img src=\"file:00230e09-61a9-484b-9645-ef413af2b2b8\" />\n",

    "content": "## Add Evaluators to existing runs\n\nYou can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.\n\n<img src=\"file:088bd4ed-4574-423e-b697-8d393e06ff5c\" alt=\"Use the **Add Evaluator** button to run more evaluators across the logs in an existing evaluation run. This can be done on any runs, including those still running or already completed.\" />\n\n## Improved Evaluation Debug Console\n\nWe've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.\n\n![](file:6118f4b8-8e83-4616-879f-9c45c156766a)\n\nOn any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.\n\nAfter clicking **Run** to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.\n\n![](file:0c0c1802-168e-4645-bde8-5f2a62dcba8b)\n\n## LLM Evaluators\n\nWe expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.\n\nAfter clicking **Run** on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the **LLM Evaluation Log** column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.\n\n![](file:e1a43293-9ea1-4e5a-aa03-45e7f68fec98)\n\nThis is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.\n\n![](file:fed5fba1-2196-4bd9-95e7-925b72a5a74b)\n\n## Tool projects\n\nWe have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config [in the Editor](/docs/guides/create-a-tool-in-the-editor) as well as tools [managed at organization level](/docs/guides/link-a-jsonschema-tool).\n\nIt is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.\n\n![](file:f90baa0d-d702-4a46-b632-46e372320c78)\n\n### Tool versioning\n\nIn the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.\n\n### Logs\n\nAny logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our [sessions guide](https://dash.readme.com/project/humanloop/v4.0/docs/logging-session-traces) and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session\n\n### Offline Evaluations via SDK\n\nYou can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the [Set up evaluations using API](/docs/guides/evaluations-using-api) guide.\n\n## Support for new OpenAI Models\n\nFollowing [OpenAI's latest model releases](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates), you will find support for all the latest models in our **Playground** and **Editor**.\n\n### GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo\n\nIf your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release `gpt-4-0125-preview` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.\n\n![](file:aef6d838-1f19-4314-8ea4-ad27a8f59585)\n\nWe also support the new `gpt-4-turbo-preview` model alias, which points to the latest `gpt-4-turbo` model without specifying a specific version.\n\n### Embedding Models\n\nFinally, the new embedding models - `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` are also available for use via Humanloop. The `small` model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation `ada-002` embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space.\n",

Generation of logs for the datapoints using the version of the model you are evaluating.\n2. Evaluating those logs using Evaluators.\n\nNow, using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted (see our [guide on external generations for evaluations](/docs/guides/evaluating-externally-generated-logs)).\n\nSimilarly, evaluating of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app), or self-hosted (see our [guide on self-hosted evaluations](/docs/guides/self-hosted-evaluations)).\n\nIt is now possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime logs and evaluations in any combination you wish.\n\nWhen creating an Evaluation (via the improved UI dialogue or via the API), you can set the new `hl_generated` flag to `False` to indicate that you are posting the logs from your own infrastructure. You can then also include an evaluator of type `External` to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.\n\n<img src=\"file:54ec0056-034c-4bf5-8393-d8d2846d68bd\" />\n\nYou can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of `External` (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators.\n",

Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.\n\n<img src=\"file:2cac696f-23eb-406f-8286-2c1b5427ef52\" />\n\nOur new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.\n\nOnce completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.\n\n<img src=\"file:5d6078ad-b591-47c2-81a0-015b3bc28d32\" />\n\nSet up your first Human Evaluator run by following [our guide.](/docs/guides/evaluating-with-human-feedback)\n\n## Return inputs flag\n\nWe've introduced a `return_inputs` flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.\n\nAs context model windows get increasingly larger, for example [Claude with 200k tokens](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1), it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.\n\nWhen you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the `inputs` that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.\n\nAs always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.\n\n## Gemini\n\nYou can now use Google's latest LLMs, [Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/), in Humanloop.\n\n### Setup\n\nTo use Gemini, first go to [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and generate an API key. Then, save this under the \"Google\" provider on [your API keys page](http://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys).\n\nHead over to the playground, and you should see `gemini-pro` and `gemini-pro-vision` in your list of models.\n\n<img src=\"file:432800b8-3cc7-4751-b977-5643c880c68d\" />\n\nYou can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's `/chat`endpoints.\n\n### Features\n\nGemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.\n\nHowever, note that while `gemini-pro` supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, `gemini-pro-vision` supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to [Gemini's docs](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) for more details.\n\nWhen providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL.\n",

To do so, you can now select 2 model configs in your project dashboard and click **Compare** to bring up a side-by-side comparison between them. Alternatively, open the actions menu and click **Compare to deployed**.\n\n<img src=\"file:06b0b0e3-d3b4-463c-bf65-12657d3897a8\" />\n\nThis diff compares the .prompt files representing the two model configs, and will highlight any differences such as in the model, hyperparameters, or prompt template.\n\n## LLM evals - improved data access\n\nIn order to help you write better LLM evaluator prompts, you now have finer-grained access to the objects you are evaluating.\n\nIt's now possible to access any part of the `log` and `testcase` objects using familiar syntax like `log.messages[0].content`.

    "content": "## Tool linking\n\nIt's now possible to manage tool definitions globally for your organization and re-use them across multiple projects by linking them to your model configs.\n\nPrior to this change, if you wanted to re-use the same tool definition across multiple model configs, you had to copy and paste the JSON schema snippet defining the name, description and parameters into your Editor for each case. And if you wanted to make changes to this tool, you would have to recall which model configs it was saved to prior and update them inline 1 by 1.\n\nYou can achieve this tool re-use by first defining an instance of our new `JsonSchema` tool available as another option in your global `Tools` tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as `get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')`, and then link that to as many model configs as you need within the Editor as shown below.\n\nImportantly, updates to the `get_current_weather` `JsonSchema` tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the model configs you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the prompt.\n\nThe old behaviour of defining the tool inline as part of your model config definition is still available for the cases where you do want changes in the definition of the tool to lead to new versions of the model-config.\n\n## Set up the tool\n\nNavigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the JsonSchema tool card.\n\n![](file:6403419e-e962-4627-9353-1747e57d5349)\n\nWith the dialog open, define your tool with `name`, `description`, and `parameters` values. Our guide for using [OpenAI Function Calling in the playground](/docs/guides/create-a-tool-in-the-editor) can be a useful reference in this case.\n\n## Using the tool\n\nIn the editor of your target project, link the tool by pressing the `Add Tool` button and selecting your `get_current_weather` tool.\n\n![](file:4ad4a9d7-8ce4-4996-b27c-b0cc496276f3)\n",

You can now see the stack of inputs and messages in a cleaner interface rather than having them spread into separate columns.\n\n<img src=\"file:457f922b-7a16-4f77-afa2-38df4729d821\" alt=\"Part of the updated Log Table. Inputs are now stacked with a more consistent and less-busy UI.\" />\n\nThere will be more updates soon to improve how logs and prompts are shown in tables and the drawers soon, so if you have ideas for improvements please let us know.\n\n## Introducing .prompt files\n\nWe're introducing a .prompt file format for representing model configs in a format that's both human-readable and easy to work with.\n\nFor certain use cases it can be helpful for engineers to also store their prompts alongside their app's source code in their favourite version control system. The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.\n\nThese .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.\n\n### Exporting via API\n\nTo fetch a .prompt file via the API, make `POST` request to `https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export`, where `{id}` is the ID of the model config (beginning with `config_`).\n\n### Export from Humanloop\n\nYou can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click **Export .prompt**. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).\n\n<img src=\"file:d408a762-fae6-4116-9508-9ea75091ca8e\" />\n\n### Editor\n\nAdditionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press **Cmd-Shift-E** when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.\n\n<img src=\"file:a8aa81ec-68d1-4fbb-8697-7a476a556ea5\" />\n\nMore details on our .prompt file format are available [here](/docs/guides/prompt-file-format). We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned.\n",

    "content": "## Improved RBACs\n\nWe've introduced more levels to our roles based access controls (RBACs).\n\nWe now distinguish between different roles to help you better manage your organization's access levels and permissions on Humanloop.\n\nThis is the first in a sequence of upgrades we are making around RBACs.\n\n## Organization roles\n\nEveryone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).\n\nA user can be one of the following rolws:\n\n**Admin:**The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.\n\n**Developer:**(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.\n\n**Member:**(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.\n\n## RBACs summary\n\nHere is the full breakdown of roles and access:\n\n| Action                         | Member | Developer | Admin |\n| :----------------------------- | :----- | :-------- | :---- |\n| Create and manage Prompts      | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Inspect logs and feedback      | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Create and manage evaluators   | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Run evaluations                | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Create and manage datasets     | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Create and manage API keys     |        | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Manage prompt deployments      |        | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Create and manage environments |        | ✔️        | ✔️    |\n| Send invites                   |        |           | ✔️    |\n| Set user roles                 |        |           | ✔️    |\n| Manage billing                 |        |           | ✔️    |\n| Change organization settings   |        |           | ✔️    |\n\n## Self hosted evaluations\n\nWe've added support for managing [evaluations](/docs/guides/evaluate-your-model) outside of Humanloop in your own code.\n\nThere are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.\n\nFor example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or [LLM evaluator](/docs/guides/use-llms-to-evaluate-logs) within your Humanloop project.\n\nWith this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.\n\nTo better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:\n\n- Retrieve your curated datasets\n- Trigger evaluation runs\n- Send evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators\n\nBelow is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our [guide](/docs/guides/self-hosted-evaluations) on self-hosted evaluations.\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nAPI_KEY = ...\nhumanloop = Humanloop(api_key=API_KEY)\n\n# 1. Retrieve a dataset\nDATASET_ID = ...\ndatapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(DATASET_ID).records\n\n# 2. Create an external evaluator\nevaluator = humanloop.evaluators.create(\n    name=\"My External Evaluator\",\n    description=\"An evaluator that runs outside of Humanloop runtime.\",\n    type=\"external\",\n    arguments_type=\"target_required\",\n    return_type=\"boolean\",\n)\n# Or, retrieve an existing one:\n# evaluator = humanloop.evaluators.get(EVALUATOR_ID)\n\n# 3. Retrieve a model config\nCONFIG_ID = ...\nmodel_config = humanloop.model_configs.get(CONFIG_ID)\n\n# 4. Create the evaluation run\nPROJECT_ID = ...\nevaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(\n    project_id=PROJECT_ID,\n    config_id=CONFIG_ID,\n    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],\n    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,\n)\n\n# 5. Iterate the datapoints and trigger generations\nlogs = []\nfor datapoint in datapoints:\n    log = humanloop.chat_model_config(\n        project_id=PROJECT_ID,\n        model_config_id=model_config.id,\n        inputs=datapoint.inputs,\n        messages=[\n            {key: value for key, value in dict(message).items() if value is not None}\n            for message in datapoint.messages\n        ],\n        source_datapoint_id=datapoint.id,\n    ).data[0]\n    logs.append((log, datapoint))\n\n# 6. Evaluate the results.\n#    In this example, we use an extremely simple evaluation, checking for an exact\n#    match between the target and the model's actual output.\nfor (log, datapoint) in logs:\n    # The datapoint target tells us the correct answer.\n    target = str(datapoint.target[\"answer\"])\n\n    # The log output is what the model said.\n    model_output = log.output\n\n    # The evaluation is a boolean, indicating whether the model was correct.\n    result = target == model_output\n\n    # Post the result back to Humanloop.\n    evaluation_result_log = humanloop.evaluations.log_result(\n        log_id=log.id,\n        evaluator_id=evaluator.id,\n        evaluation_run_external_id=evaluation_run.id,\n        result=result,\n    )\n\n# 7. Complete the evaluation run.\nhumanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status=\"completed\")\n\n```\n\n## Chat response\n\nWe've updated the response models of all of our [/chat](/api-reference/chats/create) API endpoints to include an output message object.\n\nUp to this point, our `chat` and `completion` endpoints had a unified response model, where the `content` of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common `output` field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate `tool_calls` field.\n\nWhen making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an `output_message` field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.\n\n**Before:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"project_id\": \"pr_GWx6n0lv6xUu3HNRjY8UA\",\n    \"data\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"data_Vdy9ZoiFv2B7iYLIh15Jj\",\n            \"index\": 0,\n            \"output\": \"Well, I gotta say, ...\",\n            \"raw_output\": \"Well, I gotta say...\",\n            \"finish_reason\": \"length\",\n            \"model_config_id\": \"config_VZAPd51sJH7i3ZsjauG2Q\",\n            \"messages\": [\n                {\n                    \"content\": \"what's your best guess...\",\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                }\n            ],\n            \"tool_calls\": null\n        }\n    ],\n...\n...\n...\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"project_id\": \"pr_GWx6n0lv6xUu3HNRjY8UA\",\n    \"data\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"data_Vdy9ZoiFv2B7iYLIh15Jj\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"output_message\": {\n                \"content\": \"Well, I gotta say, ...\",\n                \"name\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            },\n            \"index\": 0,\n            \"output\": \"Well, I gotta say, ...\",\n            \"raw_output\": \"Well, I gotta say...\",\n            \"finish_reason\": \"length\",\n            \"model_config_id\": \"config_VZAPd51sJH7i3ZsjauG2Q\",\n            \"messages\": [\n                {\n                    \"content\": \"what's your best guess...\",\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                }\n            ],\n            \"tool_calls\": null,\n        }\n    ],\n...\n...\n...\n}\n```\n\n## Snippet tool\n\nWe've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.\n\nThis functionality is provided by our new _Snippet tool_. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\n\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\n\nBefore now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.\n\n## Set up the tool\n\nNavigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.\n\n![](file:77789645-25a5-474c-8eb4-32e916a73195)\n\nWhen the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.\n\n<Info> \nYou can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.\n</Info>\n\nThe **name** field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as _assistant_ below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax `{{ assistant(key) }}`.\n\nThe **key** is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.\n\nThe **value** is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.\n\n![](file:e9b7f2c2-3cca-4175-ab20-bdf54b5db8bd)\n\n## Use the tool\n\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.\n\n![](file:2a58c905-2a8a-459e-9976-d64abf888653)\n\nThe tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our [editor environment](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.\n\nAbove we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the `{{ <your-tool-name>(key) }}` so in this case it would be `{{ assistant(key) }}`. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your `key`, in the screenshot above we used the `helpful` key to access the `You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.`string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.\n\n<Warning title=\"The snippet will only render in the preview after running the chat\">\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\n</Warning>\n\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: `{{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}`, so in this case it would be `{{ assistant(\"helpful\") }}`.\n\n![](file:40e29736-c096-4c1e-a664-1c49d645b9dc)\n\nThis is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.\n\n## What's next\n\nExplore our other tools such as the Google or Pinecone Search.

    "content": "## Parallel tool calling\n\nWe've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.\n\nWith the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as [parallel tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/parallel-function-calling).\n\n### Editor updates\n\nYou can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:\n\n- Select one of the [new turbo models](/changelog/) in the model dropdown.\n- Specify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.\n- Make a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.\n- As shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message\n\n<img src=\"file:04278432-757d-4435-8c5f-56100fc44459\" />\n\n### API implications\n\nWe've added an additional field `tool_calls` to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing `tool_call` parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.\n\nEach element in the `tool_calls` array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the `tool_call_id` must be provided, along with `role=tool` and the `content` containing the tool response.\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\n# Initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys\nhumanloop = Humanloop(api_key=\"<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>\")\n\n# form of message when providing the tool response to the model\nchat_response = humanloop.chat_deployed(\n    project_id=\"<YOUR PROJECT ID>\",\n  \tmessages: [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"content\": \"Horribly wet\"\n        \"tool_call_id\": \"call_dwWd231Dsdw12efoOwdd\"\n      }\n   ]\n)\n```\n\n## Python SDK improvements\n\nWe've improved the response models of our [Python SDK](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-python#raw-http-response) and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.\n\n### Improved response model types\n\nAs of **versions >= 0.6.0**, our Python SDK methods now return [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.\n\n- Previously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:\n\n```python\nchat_response = humanloop.chat(\n        # parameters\n    )\nprint(chat_response.project_id)\n```\n\n- With Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from \\< 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the [Raw HTTP Response section](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-python#raw-http-response).\n\n```python\nchat_response = humanloop.chat(\n        # parameters\n    )\nprint(chat_response.project_id)\n```\n\n> 🚧 Breaking change\n>\n> Moving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.\n\n### Support for timeout parameter\n\nThe default timeout used by [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.\n\nIn the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passing`timeout=1000` will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.\n\n## Multi-modal models\n\nWe've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!\n\nWe've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's [GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/vision). You can now select `gpt-4-vision-preview` in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.\n\nLet us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!\n\n### Editor quick start\n\nTo get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.\n\n- Select `gpt-4-vision-preview` in the models dropdown.\n- Click the **Add images** button within a user's chat message.\n- To add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select \"Upload image\" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.\n- Note that you can add multiple images\n\n<img src=\"file:8d079720-60dc-483d-aef1-1e6ed8c9e3cd\" />\n\nTo view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.\n\n<img src=\"file:4aeb2a4f-e28c-420a-a605-a9621931e298\" />\n\n### API quick start\n\nAssuming you have deployed your `gpt-4-vision-preview` based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\n# Initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys\nhumanloop = Humanloop(api_key=\"<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>\")\n\n# humanloop.chat_deployed(...) will call the active model config on your project.\nchat_response = humanloop.chat_deployed(\n    project_id=\"<YOUR PROJECT ID>\",\n  \tmessages: [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"image_url\",\n            \"image_url\": {\n              \"detail\": \"high\",\n              \"url\": \"https://www.acomaanimalclinictucson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_288690671-scaled.jpeg\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n)\n```\n\nAny generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:\n\n- Image messages are only supported by the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model in chat mode.\n- GPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.\n- You cannot add images to the first `system` message.\n\n## JSON mode and seed parameters\n\nWe've introduced new model config parameters for **JSON mode** and **Seed** in our Editor and API.\n\nWith the introduction of the new [OpenAI turbo models](https://docs.humanloop.com/changelog/gpt4-turbo-preview) you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; `response_format` and `seed`.\n\n<Note title=\"Further details\"> \n> \nSee further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode) and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/reproducible-outputs).\n</Note>\n\nThese new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for `response_format` or `seed` will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.\n\n<img src=\"file:9b09aa60-7621-4d2e-a4df-00100a30e85a\" />\n\n<Warning title=\"JSON mode prompts\">\nWhen using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.\n\nIn fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.\n</Warning>\n",

    "content": "## LLM Evaluators\n\nUntil now, it's been possible to trigger LLM-based evaluations by writing Python code that uses the Humanloop API to trigger the LLM generations.\n\nToday, in order to make this increasingly important workflow simpler and more intuitive, we're releasing **LLM Evaluators**, which require no Python configuration.\n\nFrom the Evaluations page, click **New Evaluator** and select LLM Evaluator.\n\n<img src=\"file:4f3985cd-4c63-474a-b630-542a689ba655\" alt=\"You can now choose between the existing Python Evaluators and our new LLM Evaluators.\" />\n\n\nInstead of a code editor, the right hand side of the page is now a prompt editor for defining instructions to the LLM Evaluator. Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.\n\n<img src=\"file:c3f52783-6241-4ca2-ae5c-c901d0d02987\" alt=\"LLM Evaluator Editor.\" />\n\n\nIn the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual `{{ variable }}` syntax, and include:\n\n- `log_inputs` - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated\n- `log_prompt` - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)\n- `log_messages` - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)\n- `log_output` - the output produced by the model\n- `log_error` - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced\n- `testcase` - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.\n\nTake a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.\n\n<img src=\"file:2873a37b-8901-4e0a-b306-09ebdef2fb09\" alt=\"LLM Evaluator presets. You'll likely need to tweak these to fit your use case.\" />\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.\n\nSince an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.\n\n## Improved evaluator editor\n\nGiven our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.\n\n![](file:be95c8e8-5c87-4176-9446-a197c8a8adbf)\n\nIn the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to: \n\n- Select the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs\n- Select the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number\n\nUnderneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets.\n\n<img src=\"file:8d9962ae-7992-4199-975d-261c54c96117\" alt=\"Preset selector.\" />\n",

In their place, we've added a table that supports sorting and rearranging of columns to help you better interrogate results.\n\n### Multiple model configs\n\nTo run evaluations against multiple model configs it's as simple as selecting the targeted model configs in the run dialog, similar to before, but multiple choices are now supported. This will trigger multiple evaluation runs at once, with each model config selected as a target.\n\n![](file:0742395d-cf92-4493-b49c-75aa8b716ffe)\n\n### Evaluation table\n\nWe've updated our evaluation runs with a table to help view the outcomes of runs in a more condensed form. It also allows you to sort results and trigger re-runs easier. As new evaluators are included, a column will be added automatically to the table. \n\n![](file:bab799a2-4b6f-4b2a-a4ee-20248aee89c3)\n\n### Re-run previous evaluations\n\nWe've exposed the re-run option in the table to allow you to quickly trigger runs again, or use older runs as a way to preload the dialog and change the parameters such as the target dataset or model config. \n\n![](file:73678520-4070-4cde-aa29-73f9181e590e)\n\n## New OpenAI turbos\n\nOff the back of OpenAI's [dev day](https://devday.openai.com/) we've added support for the new turbo [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) that were announced:\n\n- **gpt-4-1106-preview**\n- **gpt-3.5-turbo-1106**\n\nBoth of these models add a couple of nice capabilities: \n\n- Better instruction following performance\n- JSON mode that forces the model to return valid JSON\n- Can call multiple tools at once\n- Set a seed for reproducible outputs\n\nYou can now access these in your Humanloop Editor and via the API.\n\n<img src=\"file:d1e74557-544f-4df5-8890-83222766b99f\" />\n",

We're now promoting the concept to a first-class citizen within your projects. If you've previously been using testsets in the evaluations beta, you'll see that your testsets have now automatically migrated to datasets.\n\nDatasets can be created via CSV upload, converting from existing Logs in your project, or by API requests.\n\nSee our [guides on datasets](/docs/guides/datasets), which show how to upload from CSV and perform a batch generation across the whole dataset.\n\n<img src=\"file:57d041c5-dde1-4c19-9183-32c2c08c78cb\" alt=\"A single dataset that has been added to a project, with 9 datapoints.\" />\n\nClicking into a dataset, you can explore its datapoints.\n\n<img src=\"file:250dded1-5204-4b31-934d-14f2cef065e1\" alt=\"Datapoints are pre-defined input-output pairs.\" />\n\nA dataset contains a collection of prompt variable **inputs** (the dynamic values which are interpolated into your model config prompt template at generation-time), as well as a collection of **messages** forming the chat history, and a **target** output with data representing what we expect the model to produce when it runs on those inputs.\n\nDatasets are useful for evaluating the behaviour of you model configs across a well-defined collection of test cases. You can use datasets to check for regressions as you iterate your model configs, knowing that you are checking behaviour against a deterministic collection of known important examples.\n\nDatasets can also be used as collections of input data for **fine-tuning** jobs.\n",

For example, you may wish to get additional information about a user from your system based on their ID, or look up additional information based on a query from a user.\n\nTo set up the tool you need to provide the following details for your API:\n\n| Tool parameter   | Description                                                                 | Example                            |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| Name             | A unique tool name to reference as a call signature in your prompts         | `get_api_tool`                     |\n| URL              | The URL for your API endpoint                                               | https://your-api.your-domain.com   |\n| API Key Header   | The authentication header required by your endpoint.                        | `X-API-KEY`                        |\n| API Key          | The API key value to use in the authentication header.                      | `sk_1234567891011121314`           |\n| Query parameters | A comma delimited list of the query parameters to set when making requests. | user_query, client_id              |\n\n### Define your API\n\nFirst you will need to define your API. For demo purposes, we will create a [mock endpoint in postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/). Our [mock endpoint](https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop/request/12831443-9c48e591-b7b2-4a17-b56a-8050a133e1b5) simply returns details about a mock user given their `user_id`. \n\nA call to our Mock API in Python is as follows; note the query parameter `user_id`\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"https://01a02b84-08c5-4e53-b283-a8c2beef331c.mock.pstmn.io/users?user_id=01234567891011\"\nheaders = {\n  'X-API-KEY': '<API KEY VALUE>'\n}\nresponse = requests.request(\"GET\", url, headers=headers)\nprint(response.text)\n\n```\n\nAnd returns the response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_id\", \"012345678910\",\n  \"name\": \"Albert\",\n  \"company\": \"Humanloop\",\n  \"role\": \"Engineer\"\n}\n```\n\nWe can now use this tool to inject information for a given user into our prompts.\n\n### Set up the tool\n\nNavigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the `Get API Call ` tool card:\n\n<img src=\"file:d2d52bdc-ad31-45a1-86bd-e915f5e78781\" />\n\n\nConfigure the tool with your API details:\n\n<img src=\"file:46a5fdc2-46fd-4f4b-9cb1-f276677baea5\" />\n\n\n### Use the tool\n\nNow your API tool is set up, you can use it to populate input variables in your prompt templates. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. The call signature is the unique tool name with arguments for the query parameters defined when the tool was set up. \n\nIn our mock example, the signature will be:  `get_user_api(user_id)`.\n\nAn example prompt template using this tool is: \n\n```shell\nYou are a helpful assistant. Please draft an example job role summary for the following user:\n\nUser details: {{ get_user_api(user_id) }}\nKeep it short and concise.\n```\n\nThe tool requires an input value to be provided for user_id. In our [playground environment](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat:\n\n<img src=\"file:bb06e5e1-e703-4963-8110-9ae093aa5263\" />\n\n\n### What's next\n\nExplore more complex examples of context stuffing such as defining your own custom RAG service.\n",

Tools are made available to the model as functions to call using the same universal JSON schema format. \n\nAs part of this process it can be helpful to copy the full JSON definition of the tool for quickly iterating on new versions, or copy and pasting it into code. You can now do this directly from the tool definition in Editor:\n\n<img src=\"file:eb4a5f88-cff7-4934-a2cf-6dec3dc04641\" />\n\n\nSelecting the Copy button adds the full JSON definition of the tool to your clipboard:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n  \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Location\",\n        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n      },\n      \"unit\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Unit\",\n        \"enum\": [\n          \"celsius\",\n          \"fahrenheit\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n      \"location\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Single sign on (SSO)\n\nWe've added support for SOO to our signup, login and invite flows. By default users can now use their Gmail accounts to access Humanloop. \n\nFor our enterprise customers, this also unlocks the ability for us to more easily support their SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) set ups.  \n\n<img src=\"file:735f138f-c6af-44d3-a176-c2183b55551a\" />\n",

Offline evaluators test the performance of your model configs against a pre-defined suite of **testcases** - much like unit testing in traditional programming.\n\nWith this framework, you can use test-driven development practices to iterate and improve your model configs, while monitoring for regressions in CI.\n\nTo learn more about how to use online and offline evaluators, check out the [Evaluate your model](/docs/guides/evaluate-your-model) section of our guides.\n\n![](file:85348eb6-f900-47f8-96d0-1c37d5f0d125)\n",

With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.\n\n### Unified errors\n\nOur users integrate the Humanloop `/chat` and `/completion` API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.\n\nErrors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of [error response codes](/api-reference/errors#http-error-codes).\n\nWe've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for `type`, `message`, `code` and `origin`. The `origin` field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.\n\nFor example, for our `/chat ` endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for `max_tokens`, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"unprocessable_entity_error\",\n  \"message\": \"This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, you requested 10000012 tokens (12 in the messages, 10000000 in the completion). Please reduce the length of the messages or completion.\",\n  \"code\": 422,\n  \"origin\": \"OpenAI\"\n}\n```\n\n### Monitor model reliability with evals\n\nWith this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within [evaluation functions](/docs/guides/evaluate-your-model).\n\nYou can now turn on the **Errors** eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project. Or you can customise this template to track more specific error behaviour.\n\n<img src=\"file:57dccce3-7587-45e1-b666-30806ab65920\" alt=\"Errors evaluation function template now available\" />\n",

Tools follow the same universal [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition as OpenAI functions. You can now define tools as part of your model configuration in the playground. These tools are sent as OpenAI functions when running the OpenAI chat models that support function calling.\n\nThe model can choose to return a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call a function. This object is displayed as a special assistant message within the playground. You can then provide the result of the call in a message back to the model to consider, which simulates the function calling workflow.\n\n### Use tools in Playground\n\nTake the following steps to use tools for function calling in the playground:\n\n1. **Find tools:** Navigate to the playground and locate the `Tools` section. This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.\n\n![](file:4507074f-3d29-4ea5-b231-329757e00a90)\n\n2. **Create a new tool:** Click on the \"Add Tool\" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.\n\n![](file:5c4cfad2-5e18-429a-9a6d-1a24f6285c2d)\n\n3. **Edit a tool:** To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition. This will result in a new model configuration.\n\n![](file:0a23afc8-a949-4ea2-a0dd-e309e230b5f3)\n\n4. **Run a model with tools:** Once you've defined your tools, you can run the model by pressing the \"Run\" button.\n   1. If the model chooses to call a function, an assistant message will be displayed with the corresponding tool name and arguments to use.\n   2. A subsequent `Tool` message is then displayed to simulate sending the results of the call back to the model to consider.\n\n![](file:9e260b75-d1f1-4969-8946-f13b38ff7fc2)\n\n5. **Save your model config with tools** by using the **Save** button. Model configs with tools defined can then deployed to [environments](/docs/guides/deploy-to-an-environment) as normal.\n\n### Coming soon\n\nProvide the runtime for your tool under the existing pre-defined [Tools section ](https://app.humanloop.com/tools) of your organization on Humanloop.\n",

You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.\n\n#### The `Datapoint` argument\n\nThe `datapoint` passed into your function will be a Python `dict` with the following structure.\n\n```python\n{\n    \"id\":\"data_XXXX\",          # Datapoint id\n    \"model_config\": {...},     # Model config used to generate the datapoint\n    \"inputs\": {...},           # Model inputs (interpolated into the prompt)\n    \"output\": \"...\",           # Generated output from the model\n    \"provider_latency\": 0.6,   # Provider latency in seconds\n    \"metadata\": {...},         # Additional metadata attached to the logged datapoint\n    \"created_at\": \"...\",       # Creation timestamp\n    \"feedback\": [...]          # Array of feedback provided on the datapoint\n}\n```\n\nTo inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click **Random selection** in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function. \n\n<img src=\"file:a31953a3-3c29-48db-903b-815a938bfda2\" alt=\"The debug console - load datapoints to inspect the argument passed into Evaluators.\" />\n\n\nFor this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple `json.loads` call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return `False`.\n\n```python\nimport json\n    \ndef check_valid_json(datapoint):\n    try:\n        return json.loads(datapoint[\"output\"]) is not None\n    except:\n        return False\n```\n\n#### Debugging\n\nOnce you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.\n\n<img src=\"file:e04bf40a-0043-450c-be2a-bea076573b57\" alt=\"A `True` result from executing the **Valid JSON** Evaluators on the datapoint. \" />\n\n\nIf your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip. \n\nOnce you're happy with your Evaluator, click **Create** in the bottom left of the dialog.\n\n### Activate / Deactivate an Evaluator\n\nYour Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the **Evaluations** tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.\n\nEach Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator **on**, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to **that** project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).\n\nYou can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.\n\n### Aggregations and Graphs\n\nAt the top of the **Dashboard** tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project. \n\nAt the bottom of the **Dashboard** tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.\n\n<img src=\"file:9b6738cc-12cb-4b6a-9bd6-cc5d2de72c51\" alt=\"Evaluation Results through time, by model config. In this example, one of the model configs is not producing Valid JSON outputs, while the other is about 99% of the time.\" />\n\n\n#### Aggregation\n\nFor the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:\n\n- `Boolean`: percentage returning `True` of the total number of evaluated datapoints\n- `Number`: average value across all evaluated datapoints\n\n### Data logs\n\nIn the **Data** tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.\n\n<img src=\"file:35009934-65d3-437f-8246-e3f69484eba9\" alt=\"The **Data** tab for a project, showing the **Valid JSON** Evaluation Results for a set of datapoints.\" />\n\n\nFrom this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose **Run evals** from the **Actions** menu in the top right. \n\n### Available Modules\n\nThe following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:\n\n- `math`\n- `random`\n- `datetime`\n- `json` (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)\n- `jsonschema` (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)\n- `sqlglot` (useful for validating SQL query grammar)\n- `requests` (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).\n\nLet us know if you would like to see more modules available.\n",

    "content": "## Introducing Tools\n\nToday we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.\n\nTools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.\n\nRead more on [our blog](https://humanloop.com/blog/announcing-tools) and see an example of setting up a [tool for semantic search](/docs/guides/set-up-semantic-search).\n\n## OpenAI functions API\n\nWe've updated our APIs to support [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docsgpt/function-calling).\n\nOpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our `chat` and `log` endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.\n\nThis unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.\n\n### Recap on OpenAI functions\n\nAs described in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docsgpt/function-calling), the basic steps for using functions are:\n\n1. Call one of the models `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) syntax.\n2. The model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.\n3. You can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (**NB:** the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).\n4. Finally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.\n\nOpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a `get_current_weather` function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport json\n\n\n# Example dummy function hard coded to return the same weather\n# In production, this could be your backend API or an external API\ndef get_current_weather(location, unit=\"fahrenheit\"):\n    \"\"\"Get the current weather in a given location\"\"\"\n    weather_info = {\n        \"location\": location,\n        \"temperature\": \"72\",\n        \"unit\": unit,\n        \"forecast\": [\"sunny\", \"windy\"],\n    }\n    return json.dumps(weather_info)\n\n\ndef run_conversation():\n    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather like in Boston?\"}]\n    functions = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n                    },\n                    \"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            },\n        }\n    ]\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n        messages=messages,\n        functions=functions,\n        function_call=\"auto\",  # auto is default, but we'll be explicit\n    )\n    response_message = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"]\n\n    # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a function\n    if response_message.get(\"function_call\"):\n        # Step 3: call the function\n        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors\n        available_functions = {\n            \"get_current_weather\": get_current_weather,\n        }  # only one function in this example, but you can have multiple\n        function_name = response_message[\"function_call\"][\"name\"]\n        fuction_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n        function_args = json.loads(response_message[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n        function_response = fuction_to_call(\n            location=function_args.get(\"location\"),\n            unit=function_args.get(\"unit\"),\n        )\n\n        # Step 4: send the info on the function call and function response to GPT\n        messages.append(response_message)  # extend conversation with assistant's reply\n        messages.append(\n            {\n                \"role\": \"function\",\n                \"name\": function_name,\n                \"content\": function_response,\n            }\n        )  # extend conversation with function response\n        second_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n            messages=messages,\n        )  # get a new response from GPT where it can see the function response\n        return second_response\n\n\nprint(run_conversation())\n```\n\n### Using with Humanloop tools\n\nOpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.\n\nWe've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.\n\nIn the cases of OpenAIs `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.\n\nYou can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:\n\n#### Chat endpoint\n\nWe show here how to update the `run_conversation()` method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nhl = Humanloop(\n  \t# get your API key here: https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys\n    api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n)\n\ndef run_conversation():\n    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather like in Boston?\"}]\n    # functions are referred to as tools on Humanloop, but follows the same schema\n\t\ttools = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n                    },\n                    \"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            },\n        }\n    ]\n    response = hl.chat(\n      project=\"Assistant\",\n      model_config={\n        \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n      \t\"tools\": tools\n      },\n      messages=messages\n    )\n    response = response.body.data[0]\n\n    # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool\n    if response.get(\"tool_call\"):\n        # Step 3: call the function\n        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors\n        available_functions = {\n            \"get_current_weather\": get_current_weather,\n        }  # only one function in this example, but you can have multiple\n        function_name = response_message[\"function_call\"][\"name\"]\n        fuction_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n        function_args = json.loads(response[\"tool_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n        function_response = fuction_to_call(\n            location=function_args.get(\"location\"),\n            unit=function_args.get(\"unit\"),\n        )\n\n        # Step 4: send the response back to the model\n        messages.append(response_message)\n        messages.append(\n            {\n                \"role\": \"tool\",\n                \"name\": function_name,\n                \"content\": function_response,\n            }\n        )\n        second_response = hl.chat(\n          project=\"Assistant\",\n          model_config={\n            \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n            \"tools\": tools\n          },\n          messages=messages\n        )\n        return second_response\n```\n\nAfter running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:\n\n![](file:d3fcafd5-8dff-4584-bdf5-980a87614427)\n\n#### Log endpoint\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nhl = Humanloop(\n  \t# get your API key here: https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys\n    api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n)\n\ndef run_conversation():\n    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather like in Boston?\"}]\n    functions = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n                    },\n                    \"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            },\n        }\n    ]\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n        messages=messages,\n        functions=functions,\n        function_call=\"auto\",  # auto is default, but we'll be explicit\n    )\n    response_message = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"]\n\n\t\t# log the result to humanloop\n    log_response = hl.log(\n       project=\"Assistant\",\n          model_config={\n            \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n            \"tools\": tools,\n          },\n          messages=messages,\n      \t\ttool_call=response_message.get(\"function_call\")\n    )\n\n    # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a function\n    if response_message.get(\"function_call\"):\n        # Step 3: call the function\n        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid;

    "content": "## Deployment environments\n\nWe've added support for environments to your deployments in Humanloop!\n\nThis enables you to deploy your model configurations to specific environments. You'll no longer have to duplicate your projects to manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you'll have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.\n\n### Enabling environments for your organisation\n\nEvery organisation automatically receives a default production environment. For any of your existing projects that had active deployments define, these have been automatically migrated over to use the default environment with no change in behaviour for the APIs.\n\nYou can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's [environments page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments).\n\n#### Creating an environment\n\nEnter a custom name in the create environment dialog. Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.\n\n![](file:c987da1d-9f61-46e6-ad6b-358acac5918b)\n\nThe environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.\n\n![](file:f8d8d011-8051-4e9a-b6e0-79f06dc95dad)\n\n#### The default environment\n\nBy default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the \"Active Deployment,\" such as [Get Active Config](/api-reference/projects/getactiveconfig) or [Chat Deployed](/api-reference/chats/createdeployed) will use this environment.\n\n<Warning> \nRenaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.\n</Warning>\n\n### Using environments\n\nOnce created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.\n\nYou can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the **Deployments** section.\n\n![](file:d2a9f417-bc43-4729-beb0-52adc535df07)\n\nAlternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.\n\n### Using environments via API\n\n![](file:705f0552-7c7a-4cab-aa7d-a2519c207374)\n\nFor v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as [Get Active Config](/api-reference/projects/getactiveconfig) or [Chat Deployed](/api-reference/chats/createdeployed), you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional `environment` field.\n\nYou can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the \"Use API\" option.\n\nClicking on the \"Use API\" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the `environment` variable in practice.\n\n![](file:67da63be-577c-4fe7-a35a-78522f699c41)\n",

To set this up, visit your [organization's settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys).\n\n### Enabling Azure OpenAI for your organization\n\nAs a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the [Azure OpenAI docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.\n\n![](file:b06dd293-de11-4cbe-9583-1b71a9312c7d)\n\nClick the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.\n\nYour endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.\n\nYour API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.\n\n### Working with Azure OpenAI models\n\nOnce you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the [playground](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.\n\n<img src=\"file:8f584d3e-49dd-4112-b46c-594acb505886\" />\n\n### REST API and Python / TypeScript support\n\nAs with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop [REST API or our SDKs](/docs/api-reference/sdks).\n\n```typescript\nimport { Humanloop } from \"humanloop\";\n\nconst humanloop = new Humanloop({\n  apiKey: \"API_KEY\",\n});\n\nconst chatResponse = await humanloop.chat({\n  project: \"project_example\",\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: \"Write me a song\",\n    },\n  ],\n  provider_api_keys: {\n    openai_azure: OPENAI_AZURE_API_KEY,\n    openai_azure_endpoint: OPENAI_AZURE_ENDPOINT,\n  },\n  model_config: {\n    model: \"my-azure-deployed-gpt-4\",\n    temperature: 1,\n  },\n});\n\nconsole.log(chatResponse);\n```\n\nIn the `model_config.model` field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).\n\nThe request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the `provider_api_keys` field, as shown in the example above.\n\n### Note: Naming Model Deployments\n\nWhen you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of `gpt-35-turbo` in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like `my-orgs-llm-model`.\n\nIn order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like `gpt-35-turbo`, or the base model name with a custom prefix like `my-org-gpt-35-turbo`. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting `max_tokens=-1` in your model configs fail to work as expected.\n",

As with other providers, each user in your organization can also set a personal override API key, stored locally in the browser, for use in Cohere requests from the Playground.\n\n### Enabling Cohere for your organization\n\n<img src=\"file:76e1d4d3-4683-4d96-98b4-df9062c314e5\" alt=\"Add your Cohere API key to your organization settings to start using Cohere models with Humanloop.\" />\n\n### Working with Cohere models\n\nOnce you've successfully enabled Cohere for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the [playground](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) and in your projects, in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.\n\n<img src=\"file:5f66beef-0b63-4b1b-bc04-9542bfe80a3d\" />\n\n### REST API and Python / TypeScript support\n\nAs with other model providers, once you've set up a Cohere-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop [REST API or our SDKs](/docs/api-reference/sdks).\n\n```typescript\nimport { Humanloop } from \"humanloop\";\n\nconst humanloop = new Humanloop({\n  apiKey: \"API_KEY\",\n});\n\nconst chatResponse = await humanloop.chat({\n  project: \"project_example\",\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: \"Write me a song\",\n    },\n  ],\n  provider_api_keys: {\n    cohere: COHERE_API_KEY,\n  },\n  model_config: {\n    model: \"command\",\n    temperature: 1,\n  },\n});\n\nconsole.log(chatResponse);\n```\n\nIf you don't provide a Cohere API key under the `provider_api_keys` field, the request will fall back on the stored organization level key you configured above.\n",

    "content": "## Improved Python SDK\n\nWe've just released a new version of our Python SDK supporting our v4 API!\n\nThis brings support for:\n\n- 💬 Chat mode `humanloop.chat(...)`\n- 📥 Streaming support `humanloop.chat_stream(...)`\n- 🕟 Async methods `humanloop.acomplete(...)`\n\n[https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/)\n\n### Installation\n\n`pip install --upgrade humanloop`\n\n### Example usage\n\n```python\ncomplete_response = humanloop.complete(\n  project=\"sdk-example\",\n  inputs={\n    \"text\": \"Llamas that are well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning and are very friendly and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.[33]\",\n  },\n  model_config={\n    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    \"max_tokens\": -1,\n    \"temperature\": 0.7,\n    \"prompt_template\": \"Summarize this for a second-grade student:\\n\\nText:\\n{{text}}\\n\\nSummary:\\n\",\n  },\n  stream=False,\n)\npprint(complete_response)\npprint(complete_response.project_id)\npprint(complete_response.data[0])\npprint(complete_response.provider_responses)\n```\n\n### Migration from `0.3.x`\n\nFor those coming from an older SDK version, this introduces some breaking changes. A brief highlight of the changes:\n\n- The client initialization step of `hl.init(...)` is now `humanloop = Humanloop(...)`.\n  - Previously `provider_api_keys` could be provided in `hl.init(...)`. They should now be provided when constructing `Humanloop(...)` client.\n  - ```python\n    humanloop = Humanloop(\n        api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n        openai_api_key=\"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\",\n        anthropic_api_key=\"YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\",\n    )\n    ```\n- `hl.generate(...)`'s various call signatures have now been split into individual methods for clarity. The main ones are:\n  - `humanloop.complete(project, model_config={...}, ...)` for a completion with the specified model config parameters.\n  - `humanloop.complete_deployed(project, ...)` for a completion with the project's active deployment.\n",

Click ‘**+ New**’ and create a **Prompt**.\n\n<img src=\"file:ad732e1d-77a8-4576-9933-1db6f9d9d28f\" />\n\nIn the sidebar, rename this file to \"Comedian Bot\" now or later.\n\n### Create the Prompt template in the Editor\n\nThe left hand side of the screen defines your Prompt – the parameters such as model, temperature and template. The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.\n\n<img src=\"file:b9ed95cc-edc2-4c49-b8d3-4f164a083123\" />\n\nClick the “**+ Message**” button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.\n\n<img src=\"file:5d7dd0e4-73f6-41b9-ad2b-60ba9f349f26\" />\n\nAdd the following templated message to the chat template.\n\n```\nYou are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.\n```\n\nThis message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called `topic` (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.\n\nOn the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the **Inputs** section for `topic`.\n\n1. Add a value for `topic` e.g. music, jogging, whatever\n2. Click **Run** in the bottom right of the page\n\nThis will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is _very_ funny.\n\nYou now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.\n\n### Commit your first version of this Prompt\n\n1. Click the **Commit** button\n2. Put “initial version” in the commit message field\n3. Click **Commit**\n\n<img src=\"file:386f75eb-c97a-4923-9823-168a14848719\" />\n\n### View the logs\n\nUnder the Prompt File, click ‘Logs’ to view all the generations from this Prompt\n\nClick on a row to see the details of what version of the prompt generated it. From here you can give feedback to that generation, see performance metrics, open up this example in the Editor, or add this log to a dataset.\n\n<img src=\"file:f2b286b8-7fcf-4323-9308-6ca5fbc22e44\" />\n\n</Steps>",

This will automatically create an API route at `/api/chat`. In the call to the Humanloop SDK, you'll need to pass the project name you created in step 1.\n\n```typescript app/api/chat/route.ts\nimport { Humanloop, ChatMessageWithToolCall } from \"humanloop\";\n\nif (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {\n  throw Error(\n    \"no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: `HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=...\"\n  );\n}\n\nconst humanloop = new Humanloop({\n  basePath: \"https://api.humanloop.com/v4\",\n  apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,\n});\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request): Promise<Response> {\n  const messages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] =\n    (await req.json()) as ChatMessageWithToolCall[];\n  console.log(messages);\n\n  const response = await humanloop.chatDeployed({\n    project: \"chat-tutorial-ts\",\n    messages,\n  });\n\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(response.data.data[0].output));\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we're calling `humanloop.chatDeployed`. This function is used to target the model which is actively deployed on your project - in this case it should be the model we set up in step 1. Other related functions in the [SDK reference](/docs/api-reference/sdks) (such as `humanloop.chat`) allow you to target a specific model config (rather than the actively deployed one) or even specify model config directly in the function call.\n\nWhen we receive a response from Humanloop, we strip out just the text of the chat response and send this back to the client via a `Response` object (see [Next.js - Route Handler docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers)). The Humanloop SDK response contains much more data besides the raw text, which you can inspect by logging to the console.\n\nFor the above to work, you'll need to ensure that you have a `.env.local` file at the root of your project directory with your Humanloop API key. You can generate a Humanloop API key by clicking your name in the bottom left and selecting [API keys.](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) This environment variable will only be available on the Next.js server, not on the client (see [Next.js - Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)).\n\n```text .env.local\nHUMANLOOP_API_KEY=...\n```\n\nNow, modify `page.tsx` to use a `fetch` request against the new API route.\n\n```typescript page.tsx\nconst onSend = async () => {\n  // REPLACE ME NOW\n\n  setMessages(newMessages);\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"/api/chat\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(newMessages),\n  });\n\n  const res = await response.json();\n\n  // END REPLACE ME\n};\n```\n\nYou should now find that your application works as expected. When we send messages from the client, a GPT response appears beneath (after a delay).\n\n<img src=\"file:55e6b823-989b-4136-8aa7-662e85a6b7af\" />\n\nBack in your Humanloop Prompt dashboard you should see Logs being recorded as clients interact with your model.\n\n<img src=\"file:35969747-ab10-4420-9f7e-e40d54c20ee7\" />",

    "content": "(Note: requires Node version 18+).\n\nYou may notice that model responses can take a while to appear on screen. Currently, our Next.js API route blocks while the entire response is generated, before finally sending the whole thing back to the client browser in one go. For longer generations, this can take some time, particularly with larger models like GPT-4. Other model config settings can impact this too.\n\nTo provide a better user experience, we can deal with this latency by streaming tokens back to the client as they are generated and have them display eagerly on the page. The Humanloop SDK wraps the model providers' streaming functionality so that we can achieve this. Let's incorporate streaming tokens into our app next.\n\nEdit the API route at to look like the following. Notice that we have switched to using the `humanloop.chatDeployedStream` function, which offers [Server Sent Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) streaming as new tokens arrive from the model provider.\n\n```typescript app/api/chat/route.ts\nimport { Humanloop, ChatMessageWithToolCall } from \"humanloop\";\n\nif (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {\n  throw Error(\n    \"no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: `HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=...\"\n  );\n}\n\nconst humanloop = new Humanloop({\n  basePath: \"https://api.humanloop.com/v4\",\n  apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,\n});\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request): Promise<Response> {\n  const messages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] =\n    (await req.json()) as ChatMessageWithToolCall[];\n\n  const response = await humanloop.chatDeployedStream({\n    project: \"chat-tutorial-ts\",\n    messages,\n  });\n\n  return new Response(response.data);\n}\n```\n\nNow, modify the `onSend` function in `page.tsx` to the following. This streams the response body in chunks, updating the UI each time a new chunk arrives.\n\n```typescript app/page.tsx\nconst onSend = async () => {\n  const userMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {\n    role: \"user\",\n    content: inputValue,\n  };\n\n  setInputValue(\"\");\n\n  const newMessages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] = [\n    ...messages,\n    userMessage,\n    { role: \"assistant\", content: \"\" },\n  ];\n\n  setMessages(newMessages);\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"/api/chat\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(newMessages),\n  });\n\n  if (!response.body) throw Error();\n\n  const decoder = new TextDecoder();\n  const reader = response.body.getReader();\n  let done = false;\n  while (!done) {\n    const chunk = await reader.read();\n    const value = chunk.value;\n    done = chunk.done;\n    const val = decoder.decode(value);\n    const jsonChunks = val\n      .split(\"}{\")\n      .map(\n        (s) => (s.startsWith(\"{\") ? \"\" : \"{\") + s + (s.endsWith(\"}\") ? \"\" : \"}\")\n      );\n    const tokens = jsonChunks.map((s) => JSON.parse(s).output).join(\"\");\n\n    setMessages((messages) => {\n      const updatedLastMessage = messages.slice(-1)[0];\n\n      return [\n        ...messages.slice(0, -1),\n        {\n          ...updatedLastMessage,\n          content: (updatedLastMessage.content as string) + tokens,\n        },\n      ];\n    });\n  }\n};\n```\n\nYou should now find that tokens stream onto the screen as soon as they are available.\n\n<img src=\"file:3c5ff707-1ca8-4f3d-8a32-7566975c9731\" />",

Note that we'll only have ids for assistant messages, and `null` for user messages.\n\n```typescript page.tsx\n// A new type which also includes the Humanloop data_id for a message generated by the model.\ninterface ChatListItem {\n  id: string | null; // null for user messages, string for assistant messages\n  message: ChatMessageWithToolCall;\n}\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const [chatListItems, setChatListItems] =\n      useState<ChatListItem[]>([]); // <- update to use the new type\n  ...\n\n```\n\nModify the `onSend` function to look like this:\n\n```typescript page.tsx\nconst onSend = async () => {\n  const userMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {\n    role: \"user\",\n    content: inputValue,\n  };\n\n  setInputValue(\"\");\n\n  const newItems: ChatListItem[] = [\n    // <- modified to update the new list type\n    ...chatListItems,\n    { message: userMessage, id: null },\n    { message: { role: \"assistant\", content: \"\" }, id: null },\n  ];\n\n  setChatListItems(newItems);\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"/api/chat\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(newItems.slice(0, -1).map((item) => item.message)), // slice off the final message, which is the currently empty placeholder for the assistant response\n  });\n\n  if (!response.body) throw Error();\n\n  const decoder = new TextDecoder();\n  const reader = response.body.getReader();\n  let done = false;\n  while (!done) {\n    const chunk = await reader.read();\n    const value = chunk.value;\n    done = chunk.done;\n    const val = decoder.decode(value);\n    const jsonChunks = val\n      .split(\"}{\")\n      .map(\n        (s) => (s.startsWith(\"{\") ? \"\" : \"{\") + s + (s.endsWith(\"}\") ? \"\" : \"}\")\n      );\n    const tokens = jsonChunks.map((s) => JSON.parse(s).output).join(\"\");\n    const id = JSON.parse(jsonChunks[0]).id; // <- extract the data id from the streaming response\n\n    setChatListItems((chatListItems) => {\n      const lastItem = chatListItems.slice(-1)[0];\n      const updatedId = id || lastItem.id; // <- use the id from the streaming response if it's not already set\n      return [\n        ...chatListItems.slice(0, -1),\n        {\n          ...lastItem,\n          message: {\n            ...lastItem.message,\n            content: (lastItem.message.content as string) + tokens,\n          },\n          id: updatedId, // <- include the id when we update state\n        },\n      ];\n    });\n  }\n};\n```\n\nNow, modify the `MessageRow` component to become a `ChatItemRow` component which knows about the id.\n\n```typescript page.tsx\ninterface ChatItemRowProps {\n  item: ChatListItem;\n}\n\nconst ChatItemRow: React.FC<ChatItemRowProps> = ({ item }) => {\n  const onFeedback = async (feedback: string) => {\n    const response = await fetch(\"/api/feedback\", {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ id: item.id, value: feedback }),\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex pb-4 mb-4 border-b border-gray-300\">\n      <div className=\"min-w-[80px] uppercase text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300 leading-tight pt-1\">\n        {item.message.role}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"pl-4 whitespace-pre-line\">\n        {item.message.content as string}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"grow\" />\n      <div className=\"text-xs\">\n        {item.id !== null && (\n          <div className=\"flex gap-2\">\n            <button\n              className=\"p-1 bg-gray-100 border-gray-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-200 border-1\"\n              onClick={() => onFeedback(\"good\")}\n            >\n              👍\n            </button>\n            <button\n              className=\"p-1 bg-gray-100 border-gray-600 rounded hover:bg-gray-200 border-1\"\n              onClick={() => onFeedback(\"bad\")}\n            >\n              👎\n            </button>\n          </div>\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAnd finally for `page.tsx`, modify the rendering of the message history to use the new component:\n\n```typescript page.tsx\n// OLD\n// {messages.map((msg, idx) => (\n//   <MessageRow key={idx} msg={msg}></MessageRow>\n// ))}\n\n// NEW\n{\n  chatListItems.map((item, idx) => (\n    <ChatItemRow key={idx} item={item}></ChatItemRow>\n  ));\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to create a Next.js API route for submitting feedback, similar to the one we had for making a `/chat` request. Create a new file at the path `app/api/feedback/route.ts` with the following code:\n\n```typescript api/feedback/route.ts\nimport { Humanloop } from \"humanloop\";\n\nif (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {\n  throw Error(\n    \"no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: `HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=...\"\n  );\n}\n\nconst humanloop = new Humanloop({\n  apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,\n});\n\ninterface FeedbackRequest {\n  id: string;\n  value: string;\n}\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request): Promise<Response> {\n  const feedbackRequest: FeedbackRequest = await req.json();\n\n  await humanloop.feedback({\n    type: \"rating\",\n    data_id: feedbackRequest.id,\n    value: feedbackRequest.value,\n  });\n\n  return new Response();\n}\n```\n\nThis code simply proxies the feedback request through the Next.js server. You should now see feedback buttons on the relevant rows in chat.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:95366c0f-d17b-4270-a395-1d353aa13538\"\n  alt=\"Chat interface with feedback buttons.\"\n/>\n\nWhen you click one of these feedback buttons and visit the Prompt in Humanloop, you should see the feedback logged against the log.\n\n<img src=\"file:2cf8e05e-c021-4d4d-ad14-16e57221c553\" />",

The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.\n\n<img src=\"file:b9ed95cc-edc2-4c49-b8d3-4f164a083123\" />\n\nClick the \"**+ Message**\" button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.\n\n<img src=\"file:5d7dd0e4-73f6-41b9-ad2b-60ba9f349f26\" />\n\nAdd the following templated message to the chat template.\n\n```\nYou are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.\n```\n\nThis message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called `topic` (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.\n\nOn the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the **Inputs** section for `topic`.\n\n1. Add a value for`topic` e.g. music, jogging, whatever.\n2. Click **Run** in the bottom right of the page.\n\nThis will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is _very_ funny.\n\nYou now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.\n\n### Commit your first version of this Prompt\n\n1. Click the **Commit** button\n2. Put “initial version” in the commit message field\n3. Click **Commit**\n\n<img src=\"file:386f75eb-c97a-4923-9823-168a14848719\" />\n\n### View the logs\n\nUnder the Prompt File click ‘Logs’ to view all the generations from this Prompt\n\nClick on a row to see the details of what version of the prompt generated it. From here you can give feedback to that generation, see performance metrics, open up this example in the Editor, or add this log to a dataset.\n\n<img src=\"file:f2b286b8-7fcf-4323-9308-6ca5fbc22e44\" />\n\n</Steps>\n\n---",

(Get your API key from your [Organisation Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys))\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nHUMANLOOP_API_KEY = \"\"\n\nhumanloop = Humanloop(api_key=HUMANLOOP_API_KEY)\n```\n\n### Use Humanloop to fetch the moderator response. This automatically sends the logs to Humanloop:\n\nReplace your `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` call under `# Check for abuse` with a `humanloop.chat()` call.\n\n```python\nresponse = humanloop.chat(\n    project=\"sessions_example_moderator\",\n    model_config={\n        \"model\": \"gpt-4\",\n        \"temperature\": 0,\n        \"max_tokens\": 1,\n        \"chat_template\": [\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"{{user_request}}\"},\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n                \"content\": \"You are a moderator for an AI assistant.

This is\n  useful for use cases that leverage custom models not yet supported natively by\n  Humanloop. See our [Using your own model guide](./use-your-own-model-provider)\n  for more information.\n</Tip>\n\n### Log the Google search tool result.\n\nAt the top of the file add the `inspect` import.\n\n```python\nimport inspect\n```\n\nInsert the following log request after `print(\"Google answer:\", google_answer)`.\n\n```python\nhumanloop.log(\n    project=\"sessions_example_google\",\n    config={\n        \"name\": \"Google Search\",\n        \"source_code\": inspect.getsource(get_google_answer),\n        \"type\": \"tool\",\n        \"description\": \"Searches Google for the answer to the user's question.\",\n    },\n    inputs={\"q\": user_request},\n    output=google_answer,\n)\n```\n\n### Use Humanloop to fetch the assistant response. This automatically sends the log to Humanloop.\n\nReplace your `openai.Completion.create()` call under `# Respond to request` with a `humanloop.complete()` call.\n\n```python\nresponse = humanloop.complete(\n    project=\"sessions_example_assistant\",\n    model_config={\n        \"prompt_template\": \"Question: {{user_request}}\\nGoogle result: {{google_answer}}\\nAnswer:\\n\",\n        \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\",\n        \"temperature\": 0,\n    },\n    inputs={\"user_request\": user_request, \"google_answer\": google_answer},\n)\nassistant_response = response.data[0].output\n```\n\n</Steps>\n\nYou have now connected your multiple calls to Humanloop, logging them to individual projects. While each one can be inspected individually, we can't yet view them together to evaluate and improve our pipeline.\n\n<img src=\"file:5bc7f482-6b35-4d58-8944-befad5d596dd\" />",

An increasingly complex design space.\"\n/>\n\nFor the current generation of models, at the core of any LLM app is usually some\ncombination of the following components:\n\n- **LLM model** - the core reasoning engine; an API into OpenAI, Anthropic,\n  Google, or open source alternatives like\n  [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/).\n- **Prompt template** - the boilerplate instructions to your model, which are\n  shared between requests. This is generally versioned and managed like code\n  using formats like the\n  [.prompt](https://docs.humanloop.com/docs/prompt-file-format) file.\n- **Data sources** - to provide the relevant context to the model; often\n  referred to as retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Examples being\n  traditional relational databases, graph databases, and\n  [vector databases](https://docs.humanloop.com/docs/setup-semantic-search).\n- **Memory** - like a data source, but that builds up a history of previous\n  interactions with the model for re-use.\n- **Tools** - provides access to actions like API calls and code execution\n  empowering the model to interact with external systems where appropriate.\n- **Agent control flow** - some form of looping logic that allows the model to\n  make multiple generations to solve a task before hitting some stopping\n  criteria.\n- **Guardrails** - a check that is run on the output of the model before\n  returning the output to the user.

There is a near infinite number of open or\nclosed source vector stores to choose from. Then there is the embedding model\n(that also has its own design choices), retrieval technique, similarity metric,\nhow to chunk your documents, how to sync your vector store... and the list goes\non.\n\nNot only that, but there are often complex interactions between these components\nthat are hard to predict.

    "content": "The most common judgment return types are familiar from traditional data science\nand machine learning frameworks. From simple to more complex:\n\n- **Binary** - involves a yes/no, true/false, or pass/fail judgment based on\n  some criteria.\n- **Categorical** - involves more than two categories; for exampling adding an\n  abstain or maybe option to a binary judgment.\n- **Ranking** - the relative quality of output from different samples or\n  variations of the model are being ranked from best to worst based on some\n  criteria. Preference based judgments are often used in evaluating the quality\n  of a ranking.\n- **Numerical** - involves a score, a percentage, or any other kind of numeric\n  rating.\n- **Text** - a simple comment or a more detailed critique. Often used when a\n  more nuanced or detailed evaluation of the model's output is required.\n- **Multi-task** - combines multiple types of judgment simultaneously. For\n  example, a model's output could be evaluated using both a binary rating and a\n  free-form text explanation.\n\nSimple individual judgments can be easily aggregated across a dataset of\nmultiple examples using well known metrics. For example, for classification\nproblems, [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision),\n[recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) and\n[F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) are typical choices. For rankings,\nthere are metrics like\n[NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain),\n[Elo ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) and\n[Kendall's Tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient).\nFor numerical judgments there are variations of the\n[Bleu score](https://blog.modernmt.com/understanding-mt-quality-bleu-scores/).\n\nI find that in practice binary and categorical types generally cover the\nmajority of use cases. They have the added benefit of being the most straight\nforward to source reliably. The more complex the judgment type, the more\npotential for ambiguity there is and the harder it becomes to make inferences.",

    "content": "Sourcing judgments is an area where there are new and evolving patterns around\nfoundation models like LLMs. At Humanloop, we've standardised around the\nfollowing canonical sources:\n\n- **Heuristic/Code** - using simple deterministic rules based judgments against\n  attributes like cost, token usage, latency, regex rules on the output, etc.\n  These are generally fast and cheap to run at scale.\n- **Model (or 'AI')** - using other foundation models to provide judgments on\n  the output of the component. This allows for more qualitative and nuanced\n  judgments for a fraction of the cost of human judgments.\n- **Human** - getting gold standard judgments from either end users of your\n  application, or internal domain experts. This can be the most expensive and\n  slowest option, but also the most reliable.\n\n<Frame caption=\"Typical makeup of different sources of evaluation judgments. AI evaluators are a\n   good sweet spot for scaling up your evaluation process, while still providing Human-level performance.\">\n![](https://humanloop.com/blog/evaluating-llm-apps/LLMEvals.jpg)\n</Frame>\n\nModel judgments in particular are increasingly promising and an active research\narea. The paper [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685)\ndemonstrates that an appropriately prompted GPT-4 model achieves over 80%\nagreement with human judgments when rating LLM model responses to questions on a\nscale of 1-10; that's equivalent to the levels of agreement between humans.\n\nSuch evaluators can be equally effective in evaluating the important non-LLM\ncomponents, such as the retrieval component in RAG. In\n[Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15217.pdf)\na GPT-3 model is tasked with extracting the most relevant sentences from the\nretrieved context. A numeric judgment for relevance is then computed using the\nratio of the number of relevant to irrelevant sentences, which was also found to\nbe highly correlated with expert human judgments.\n\nHowever, there are risks to consider. The same reasons that evaluating LLMs is\nhard apply to using them as evaluators. Recent research has also shown LLMs to\nhave biases that can contaminate the evaluation process. In\n[Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17012.pdf)\nthey measure 6 cognitive biases across 15 different LLM variations. They find\nthat simple details such as the order of the results presented to the model can\nhave material impact on the evaluation.\n\n<Frame caption=\"The cognitive bias benchmark for LLMs. Simple details such as the order of the results presented to the model can have material impact on the evaluation.

In addition, fine-tuning specialist, more\neconomical evaluator models using human judgements can be a real unlock.\n\nI believe teams should consider shifting more of their human judgment efforts up\na level to focus on helping improve model evaluators. This will ultimately lead\nto a more scalable, repeatable and cost-effective evaluation process. As well as\none where the human expertise can be more targeted on the most important high\nvalue scenarios.",

Humanloop for example provides\ntemplates for popular use cases and best practises, with the ability to\nexperiment and customize. There are categories like general performance\n(latency, cost and error thresholds), behavioural (tone of voice, writing style,\ndiversity, factuality, relevance, etc.), ethical (bias, safety, privacy, etc.)\nand user experience (engagement, satisfaction, productivity, etc.).\n\nUnsurprisingly, starting with a small set of evaluators that cover the most\nimportant criteria is wise.

    "content": "As discussed with the distinction between CI and observability; different stages\nof the app development lifecycle will have different evaluation needs. I've\nfound this lifecycle to naturally still consist of some sort of planning and\nscoping exercise, followed by cycles of development, deployment and monitoring.\n\nThese cycles are then repeated during the lifetime of the LLM app in order to\nintervene and improve performance. The stronger the teams, the more agile and\ncontinuous this process tends to be.\n\nDevelopment here will include both the typical app development; orchestrating\nyour LLM blocks in code, setting up your UIs, etc, as well more LLM specific\ninterventions and experimentation; including prompt engineering, context\ntweaking, tool integration updates and fine-tuning - to name a few. Both the\nchoices and quality of interventions to\n[optimize your LLM performance](https://humanloop.com/blog/optimizing-llms) are\nmuch improved if the right evaluation stages are in place. It facilitates a more\ndata-driven, systematic approach.\n\nFrom my experience there are 3 complementary stages of evaluation that are\nhighest ROI in supporting rapid iteration cycles of the LLM block related\ninterventions:\n\n1. **Interactive** - it's useful to have an interactive playground-like editor\n   environment that allows rapid experimentation with components of the model\n   and provides immediate evaluator feedback. This usually works best on a\n   relatively small number of scenarios. This allows teams (both technical and\n   non-technical) to quickly explore the design space of the LLM app and get an\n   informal sense of what works well.\n\n2. **Batch offline** - benchmarking or regression testing the most promising\n   variations over a larger curated set of scenarios to provide a more\n   systematic evaluation. Ideally a range of different evaluators for different\n   components of the app can contribute to this stage, some comparing against\n   gold standard expected results for the task. This can fit naturally into\n   existing CI processes.\n\n3. **Monitoring online** - post deployment, real user interactions can be\n   evaluated continuously to monitor the performance of the model. This process\n   can drive alerts, gather additional scenarios for offline evaluations and\n   inform when to make further interventions. Staging deployments through\n   internal environments, or beta testing with selected cohorts of users first,\n   are usually super valuable.\n\n<Frame caption=\"Recommended stages for a robust evaluation process. Interactive, offline and online.\">\n![](https://humanloop.com/blog/evaluating-llm-apps/EvalsStages.png)\n</Frame>\n\n\nIt's usually necessary to co-evolve to some degree the evaluation framework\nalongside the app development as more data becomes available and requirements\nare clarified. The ability to easily version control and share across stages and\nteams both the evaluators and the configuration of your app can significantly\nimprove the efficiency of this process.",

Visit the **Evaluations** tab, and select **Evaluators**\n2. Click **+ New Evaluator** and choose **Code** from the options.\n3. Select the **Valid JSON** preset on the left.\n4. Choose the mode **Offline** in the settings panel on the left.\n5. Click **Create**.\n6. Copy your new evaluator's ID from the address bar. It starts with `evfn_`.\n\n```python\nEVALUATOR_ID = <YOUR_EVALUATOR_ID>\n```\n\n### Create an evaluation run with `hl_generated` set to `False`\n\nThis tells the Humanloop runtime that it should not trigger evaluations but wait for them to be posted via the API.\n\n```python\nevaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(\n    project_id=PROJECT_ID,\n    config_id=CONFIG_ID,\n    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,\n    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],\n    hl_generated=False,\n)\n```\n\nBy default, the evaluation status after creation is `pending`. Before sending the generation logs, set the status to `running`.\n\n```python\nhumanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status=\"running\")\n```\n\n### Iterate through the datapoints in the dataset, produce a generation and post the evaluation\n\n```python\nfor datapoint in datapoints:\n\t\t# Use the datapoint to produce a log with the model config you are testing.\n    # This will depend on whatever model calling setup you are using on your side.\n    # For simplicity, we simply log a hardcoded\n    log = {\n        \"project_id\": PROJECT_ID,\n        \"config_id\": CONFIG_ID,\n        \"messages\":  [*config.chat_template, *datapoint.messages],\n        \"output\": \"Hello World!\",\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Logging generation for datapoint {datapoint.id}\")\n    humanloop.evaluations.log(\n        evaluation_id=evaluation_run.id,\n        log=log,\n        datapoint_id=datapoint.id,\n    )\n```\n\n#### Run the full script above.\n\nIf everything goes well, you should now have posted a new evaluation run to Humanloop and logged all the generations derived from the underlying datapoints.\n\nThe Humanloop evaluation runtime will now iterate through those logs and run the **Valid JSON** evaluator on each. To check progress:\n\n### Visit your project in the Humanloop app and go to the **Evaluations** tab.\n\nYou should see the run you recently created; click through to it, and you'll see rows in the table showing the generations.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"file:39edb66d-3992-49ee-a731-7113e9b1c161\" />\n</Frame>\n\nIn this case, all the evaluations returned `False` because the \"Hello World!\" string wasn't valid JSON. Try logging something valid JSON to check that everything works as expected.\n\n</Steps>",

So in our model config, we'll need to include `{{ user_query }}` somewhere, and that placeholder will be populated with the value from the `user_query` input in the datapoint at generation-time.\n   - You can include as many columns of prompt variables as you need for your model configs.\n   - There is additionally a column called `target` which will populate the target of the datapoint. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.\n   - Note: `messages` are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be verbose and hard-to-read JSON. If you want a dataset with messages, consider using the API to upload, or convert from existing logs.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:614d15f5-ae0a-416c-bd14-d7cd3ced8594\"\n  alt=\"A CSV file in Google Sheets defining a collection of 9 datapoints.\"\n/>\n\n### Export the Google Sheet to CSV\n\nChoose **File** → **Download** → **Comma-separated values (.csv)**\n\n### Create a new Dataset File\n\n### Click **Upload CSV**\n\nUupload the CSV file from step 2 by drag-and-drop or using the file explorer.\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:d801c45b-910b-40a3-a244-5dbd15c2864e\"\n  alt=\"Uploading a CSV file to create a dataset.\"\n/>\n\n### Click **Upload Dataset from CSV**\n\nYou should see a new dataset appear in the datasets tab.

For this dataset, we have specified the correct category for each datapoint, so we'll be able to know easily if the model produced the correct output.\n\n<Steps>\n### In Editor, create a simple completion model config as below.\n\n<img src=\"file:d11083f1-60c0-4936-a5d9-2e55777796c4\" />\n\nWe've used the following prompt:\n\n_You are a customer support classifier for Humanloop, a platform for building applications with LLMs._\n\n_Please classify the following customer support query into one of these categories:\n[datasets, docs, evaluators, feedback, fine-tuning, model configs, model providers]_\n\n_{{user_query}}_\n\nThe most important thing here is that we have included a **prompt variable** - `{{ user_query }}` which corresponds to the input key on all the datapoints in our dataset. This was the first column header in the CSV file we used to upload the dataset.\n\n### Save the model config by clicking the **Save** button. Call the config `support_classifier`.\n\n### Go to the **Datasets** tab\n\n### Click the menu icon in the top-right corner of the dataset you want to perform a batch generation across.\n\n### In that menu, choose **Batch Generate & Eval**\n\n<img\n  src=\"file:0656e01f-3445-4248-940c-2b9b89e88b23\"\n  alt=\"Trigger a batch generation on a dataset from this menu.\"\n/>\n\n### In the dialog window, choose the `support_classifier` model config created in step 2.\n\n### You can also optionally select an evaluator to use to compare the model's generation output to the target output in each datapoint. We set up the `Exact match` offline evaluator in our project (it's one of the builtins and requires no further configuration).\n\n### Click **Batch generate**\n\n### Follow the link in the pop-up to the batch generation run which is under the **Evaluations** tab.\n\n<img src=\"file:e3f6d021-567c-443e-86bf-8f06ede42b3e\" alt=\"The batch generate output view, including an **exact match** evaluator.\" />\n</Steps>\n\nThe output the model produced is shown in the **output** column, and the exact match column shows that the model produced the expected (target) output in most cases. From here, we could inspect the failing cases and iterate on our model config before testing again to see if the accuracy across the whole dataset has improved.",

    "content": "- A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.\n- You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/guides/create-prompt) guide first.\n\n<Info title=\"Models supporting Tool Calling\">\nTo view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the [Models page](/docs/supported-models#models).\n</Info>\n\n\nTo create and use a tool follow the following steps:\n\n<Steps>\n### **Open the editor**\nStart by opening the Humanloop Editor in your web browser. You can access this directly from your Humanloop account dashboard.\n\n### **Select the model**\n\nIn the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose `gpt-4` from the dropdown list.\n\n### **Define the tool**\n\nTo define a tool, you'll need to use the universal [JSON Schema syntax](https://json-schema.org/) syntax. For the purpose of this guide, let's select one of our preloaded example tools `get_current_weather`. In practice this would correspond to a function you have defined locally, in your own code, and you are defining the parameters and structure that you want OpenAI to respond with to integrate with that function.\n\n<img src=\"file:0d148432-70f4-4c8b-91aa-23d2854e8331\" />\n\n### **Input user text**\n\nLet's input some user text relevant to our tool to trigger OpenAI to respond with the corresponding parameters. Since we're using a weather-related tool, type in: `What's the weather in Boston?`.\n\n<Tip title=\"Function calling responds relative to the user input\">\n\nIt should be noted that a user can ask a non-weather related question such as '_how are you today?_ ' and it likely wouldn't trigger the model to respond in a format relative to the tool.\n\n</Tip>\n\n### **Check assistant response**\n\nIf correctly set up, the assistant should respond with a prompt to invoke the tool, including the name of the tool and the data it requires. For our `get_current_weather` tool, it might respond with the relevant tool name as well as the fields you requested, such as:\n\n```\nget_current_weather\n\n{\n  \"location\": \"Boston\"\n}\n```\n\n### **Input tool parameters**\n\nThe response can be used locally or for prototyping you can pass in any relevant values. In the case of our `get_current_weather` tool, we might respond with parameters such as temperature (e.g., 22) and weather condition (e.g., sunny). To do this, in the tool response add the parameters in the in the format `{ \"temperature\": 22, \"condition\": \"sunny\" }`. To note, the response format is also flexible, inputting `22, sunny` likely also works and might help you iterate more quickly in your experimentation.\n\n### **Submit tool response**\n\nAfter defining the parameters, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to OpenAI.\n\n### **Review assistant response**\n\nThe assistant should now respond using your parameters. For example, it might say: `The current weather in Boston is sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees.`\n\n<img src=\"file:638fd12b-40d5-4e3a-845a-ad4a6c767438\" />\n\n### **Save the model config**\n\nIf you are happy with your tool, you can save the model config. The tool will be saved on that model config and can be used again in the future by loading the model config again in the editor or by calling the model config via our SDK.\n\n</Steps>",

    "content": "<Warning>The SDK requires Python 3.8 or greater.</Warning>\n\n<Steps>\n### **Import the Humanloop SDK**: If you haven't done so already, you'll need to install and import the Humanloop SDK into your Python environment. You can do this using pip:\n\n```python\npip install humanloop\n```\n\n_Note, this guide was built with `Humanloop==0.5.18`_.\n\nThen import the SDK in your script:\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n```\n\n### **Initialize the SDK**: Initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API key:\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nhl = Humanloop(api_key=\"<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>\")\n```\n\n### **Create a chat with the tool**: We'll start with the general chat endpoint format.\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\n\nhl = Humanloop(api_key=\"<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>\")\n\n\ndef run_conversation():\n    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather like in Boston?\"}]\n\n    # TODO - Add tools definition here\n\n    response = hl.chat(\n        project=\"Assistant\",\n        model_config={\"model\": \"gpt-4\", \"max_tokens\": 100},\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n    response = response.data[0]\n```\n\n### **Define the tool**: Define a tool using the universal [JSON Schema syntax](https://json-schema.org/) syntax. Let's assume we've defined a `get_current_weather` tool, which returns the current weather for a specified location. We'll add it in via a `\"tools\": tools,` field. We've also defined a dummy `get_current_weather` method at the top. This can be replaced by your own function to fetch real values, for now we're hardcoding it to return a random temperature and cloudy for this example.\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\nimport random\nimport json\n\nhl = Humanloop(api_key=\"<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>\")\n\ndef get_current_weather(location, unit):\n    # Your own function call logic\n    # We will return dummy values in this example\n\n    # Generate random temperature between 0 and 20\n    temperature = random.randint(0, 20)\n\n    return {\"temperature\": temperature, \"other\": \"cloudy\"}\n\n\n\ndef run_conversation():\n    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"What's the weather like in both Boston AND London tonight?\",\n        }\n    ]\n    tools = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n                    },\n                    \"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            },\n        },\n    ]\n\n    response = hl.chat(\n        project=\"Assistant\",\n        model_config={\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\", \"tools\": tools, \"max_tokens\": 100},\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n    response = response.body\n    output_message = response[\"data\"][0][\"output_message\"]\n\n    # Remove the deprecated tool_call field (not nessecary for SDK rc verions >0.6)\n    del output_message[\"tool_call\"]\n\n    # Add the output messge from the previous chat to the messages\n    messages.append(output_message)\n\n    # TODO - Add assistant response logic\n```\n\n### **Check assistant response**\n\nThe code above will make the call to OpenAI with the tool but it does nothing to handle the assistant response. When responding with a tool response the response should have a `tool_calls` field. Fetch that value and pass it to your own function. An example of this can be seen below. Replace the `TODO - Add assistant handling logic` in your code from above with the following. Multiple tool calls can be returned with the latest OpenAI models `gpt-4-1106-preview` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`, so below we loop through the tool_calls and populate the response accordingly.\n\n```python\n\t\t# Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool\n  \tif output_message.get(\"tool_calls\"):\n        # Step 3: call the function\n        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors\n        available_functions = {\n            \"get_current_weather\": get_current_weather,\n        }\n\n        for tool_call in output_message[\"tool_calls\"]:\n            function_name = tool_call[\"function\"][\"name\"]\n            function_args = json.loads(tool_call[\"function\"][\"arguments\"])\n            function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n            function_response = function_to_call(\n                location=function_args.get(\"location\"),\n                unit=function_args.get(\"unit\"),\n\n        # TODO - return the tool response back to OpenAI\n```\n\n### **Return the tool response**\n\nWe can then return the tool response to OpenAI. This can be done by formatting OpenAI tool message into the relative `assistant` message seen below along with a `tool` message with the function name and function response.\n\n```python\n\t\t# Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool\n    if output_message.get(\"tool_calls\"):\n        # Step 3: call the function\n        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors\n        available_functions = {\n            \"get_current_weather\": get_current_weather,\n        }\n\n        for tool_call in output_message[\"tool_calls\"]:\n            function_name = tool_call[\"function\"][\"name\"]\n            function_args = json.loads(tool_call[\"function\"][\"arguments\"])\n            function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n            function_response = function_to_call(\n                location=function_args.get(\"location\"),\n                unit=function_args.get(\"unit\"),\n            )\n\n            # Step 4: send the response back to the model per function call\n            messages.append(\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"tool\",\n                    \"content\": json.dumps(function_response),\n                    \"tool_call_id\": tool_call[\"id\"],\n                }\n            )\n\n        second_response = hl.chat(\n            project=\"Assistant\",\n            model_config={\n                \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\",\n                \"tools\": tools,\n                \"max_tokens\": 500,\n            },\n            messages=messages,\n        )\n        return second_response\n```\n\n### **Review assistant response**\n\nThe assistant should respond with a message that incorporates the parameters you provided, for example: `The current weather in Boston is 22 degrees and cloudy.` The above can be run by adding the python handling logic at the both of your file:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    response = run_conversation()\n    response = response.data[0].output\n    # Print to console the response from OpenAI with the formatted message\n    print(response)\n```\n\nThe full code from this example can be seen below:\n\n```python\nfrom humanloop import Humanloop\nimport random\nimport json\n\nhl = Humanloop(\n    api_key=\"<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>\",\n)\n\n\ndef get_current_weather(location, unit):\n    # Your own function call logic\n    # We will return dummy values in this example\n\n    # Generate random temperature between 0 and 20\n    temperature = random.randint(0, 20)\n\n    return {\"temperature\": temperature, \"other\": \"cloudy\"}\n\n\ndef run_conversation():\n    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"What's the weather like in both Boston AND London tonight?\",\n        }\n    ]\n    tools = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",\n                    },\n                    \"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            },\n        },\n    ]\n\n    response = hl.chat(\n        project=\"Assistant\",\n        model_config={\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\", \"tools\": tools, \"max_tokens\": 100},\n        messages=messages,\n    )\n    response = response.body\n    output_message = response[\"data\"][0][\"output_message\"]\n\n    # Remove the deprecated tool_call field (not nessecary for SDK rc verions >0.6)\n    del output_message[\"tool_call\"]\n\n    # Add the output messge from the previous chat to the messages\n    messages.append(output_message)\n\n    # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool\n    if output_message.get(\"tool_calls\"):\n        # Step 3: call the function\n        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid;

Please contact us if you wish\n  to learn more about our [Enterprise plan](https://humanloop.com/pricing)\n</Note>\n\n\n<Steps>\n### Create a Tool file\n\nClick the 'New File' button on the homepage or in the sidebar.\n\n### Select the **Json Schema** Tool type\n\n### Define your tool\n\nSet the `name`, `description`, and `parameters` values. Our guide for using [Tool Calling in the Prompt Editor](./create-a-tool-in-the-editor) can be a useful reference in this case. We can use the `get_current_weather` schema in this case. Paste the following into the dialog:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n  \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Location\",\n        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n      },\n      \"unit\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Unit\",\n        \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Press the **Create** button.\n\n### Navigate to the **Editor**\n\nMake sure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as `gpt-4o`.\n\n<Info title=\"Models supporting Tool calling\">\n\nSee the [Models page](/docs/supported-models) for a list of models that support tool calling.\n\n</Info>\n\n### **Add Tool** to the Prompt definition.\n\n### Select 'Link existing Tool'\n\nIn the dropdown, go to the **Link existing tool** option. You should see your `get_current_weather` tool, click on it to link it to your editor.\n\n<img src=\"file:82b8db60-27bd-4436-bb3c-8f1da79407e9\" />\n\n### Test that the Prompt is working with the tool\n\nNow that your tool is linked you can start using it as you would normally use an inline tool. In the **Chat** section, in the **User** input, enter \"What is the weather in london?\"\n\nPress the **Run** button.\n\nYou should see the **Assistant** respond with the tool response and a new **Tool** field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in `22` into the tool response and press **Run**.\n\n<img src=\"file:1835f4ab-748e-4a64-8764-f69adb82d602\" />\n\nThe model will respond with `The current weather in London is 22 degrees`.\n\n### Save the Prompt\n\nYou've linked a tool to your model config, now let's save it. Press the **Save** button and name your model config `weather-model-config`.\n\n### (Optional) Update the Tool\n\nNow that's we've linked your `get_current_weather` tool to your model config, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved `weather-model-config` config. Navigate back to the Tools in the sidebar and go to the Editor.\n\n### Change the tool.\n\nLet's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to `get_current_weather_updated` and for the required fields, add `unit` as a required field. The should look like this now:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_weather_updated\",\n  \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Location\",\n        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n      },\n      \"unit\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"name\": \"Unit\",\n        \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\", \"unit\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Save the Tool\n\nPress the **Save** button, then the following **Continue** button to confirm.\n\nYour tool is now updated.\n\n### Try the Prompt again\n\nNavigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the `weather-model-config` loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says `get_current_weather_updated`.\n\nIn the Chat section enter in again, `What is the weather in london?`, and press **Run** again.\n\n### Check the response\n\nYou should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the `unit` field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your model config.\n\n</Steps>\n\n<img src=\"file:d564f7b0-6b6c-4c89-b1ee-fab1311b93a1\" />\n\n<Warning title=\"Linked JSON Schema tool changes propagate to saved model configs\">\n  When updating your organization-level JSON Schema tools, remember that the\n  change will affect all the places you've previously linked the tool. Be\n  careful when making updates to not inadvertently change something you didn't\n  intend.\n</Warning>",

A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\n\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\n\nInstead of needing to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited, you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.\n\n---"

Please contact us if you\n  wish to learn more about our [Enterprise plan](https://humanloop.com/pricing)\n</Warning>\n\nTo create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:\n\n<Steps>\n### Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.\n\n<img src=\"file:f864c584-0082-4422-b02c-8af2372e4458\" />\n\n### Name the tool\n\nName it`assistant-personalities` and give it a description `Useful assistant personalities`.\n\n### Add a snippet called \"helpful-assistant\"\n\nIn the initial box add `helpful-assistant` and give it a value of `You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.`\n\n### Add another snippet called \"grumpy-assistant\"\n\nLet's add another key-value pair, so press the **Add a key/value pair** button and add a new key of `grumpy-assistant` and give it a value of `You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy.`.\n\n<img src=\"file:0297c12d-7572-4b93-8204-d9553cfc7afe\" />\n\n### Press **Create Tool**.\n\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.\n\n### Navigate to the **Editor**\n\nGo to the Editor of your previously created project.\n\n### Add `{{ assistant-personalities(key) }}` to your prompt\n\nDelete the existing prompt template and add `{{ assistant-personalities(key) }}` to your prompt.\n\n<Note title=\"**Tool syntax: {{ <tool-name>(key) }}**\">\nDouble curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor.  Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. `{{ <tool-name>(key) }}`.\n</Note>\n\n### Enter the key as an input\n\nIn the input area set the value to `helpful-assistant`. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your `key`.\n\n### Press the **Run** button\n\nStart the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.\n\n<img src=\"file:52c5db5b-1863-41e9-a5da-f86b9219505b\" />\n\n### Change the key to `grumpy-assistant`.\n\n<Warning title=\"The snippet will only render (or update) in the preview after running the chat\">\n  If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to\n  first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\n</Warning>\n\n### Play with the LLM\n\nAsk the LLM, `I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'`. You should see a grumpy response from \"Freddy\" now.\n\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: `{{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}`, so in this case it would be `{{ assistant-personalities(\"grumpy-assistant\") }}`. Delete the `grumpy-assistant` field and add it into your chat template.\n\n### **Save** your Prompt.\n\nIf you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.\n\n</Steps>\n\n<img src=\"file:79b12d9b-b906-4b77-9ae3-6e49da4ba952\" />\n\nThe Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the model configs when you update them, as long as the key is the same.\n\n<Warning title=\"Changing a snippet value can change a Prompt's behaviour\">\n  Since the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing\n  the values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools could affect the relative\n  propmt's behaviour that won't be captured by the Prompt's version. This could\n  be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the\n  changes are expected.\n</Warning>",

    "content": "<img src=\"file:eaa91cac-b21c-408b-b20c-0cc3794f34fd\" />\n\nA Prompt on Humanloop encapsulates the instructions and other configuration for how a large language model should perform a specific task. Each change in any of the following properties creates a new version of the Prompt:\n\n- the template such as `Write a song about {{topic}}`\n- the model e.g. `gpt-4o`\n- all the parameters to the model such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p` etc.\n- any tools available to the model\n\nA Prompt is callable in that if you supply the necessary inputs, it will return a response from the model.\n\nInputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. `{{topic}}` and the value of the variable will need to be supplied when you call the Prompt to create a generation.\n\nThis separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different configurations and evaluate any changes. The Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data are stored in [Logs](./logs), which can then be re-used in Datasets.\n\n<Warning>\n  FYI: Prompts have recently been renamed from 'Projects'. The Project's \"Model\n  Configs\" are now just each version of a Prompt. Some of the documentation and\n  APIs may still refer to Projects and Model Configs.\n</Warning>\n\n<Callout>\n  Note that we use a capitalized \"[Prompt](/docs/prompts)\" to refer to the\n  entity in Humanloop, and a lowercase \"prompt\" to refer to the general concept\n  of input to the model.\n</Callout>\n\n<Frame caption=\"An example Prompt, serialized as a Promptfile\">\n\n```jsx\n---\nmodel: gpt-4\ntemperature: 1.0\nmax_tokens: -1\nprovider: openai\nendpoint: chat\n---\n<system>\n  Write a song about {{topic}}\n</system>\n```\n\n</Frame>"

    "content": "In our various guides we assumed the use of our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/). There are some use cases where this is not appropriate. For example, if you are integrating Humanloop from a non-Python backend, such as Node.js, or using a no-or-low-code builder such as [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). In these cases, you can leverage our RESTful [APIs](/api-reference/projects/get) directly.\n\nTo help with direct API integrations, we maintain a [Postman Workspace](https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop) with various worked examples for the main endpoints you will need."
