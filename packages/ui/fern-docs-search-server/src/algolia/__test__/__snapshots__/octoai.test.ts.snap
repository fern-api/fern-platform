How does billing work?
OctoAI uses post-paid billing - add a credit card and pay for your use at the end of each month. All existing credits will remain available within your account and will be used before any post-paid billing is applied.
On the 1st day of each month, we’ll send an invoice so you can see the upcoming charge. On the 7th day of each month, we’ll charge the card on file for the prior billing period. If there’s an issue charging your credit card, you can manually pay via the invoice.
Where can I find my billing data?
You can view your plan tier, invoices, and itemized usage for all OctoAI services in Billing & Usage in your account at anytime.
What are the rate limits for each solution?
See rate limits for details, and feel free to contact us to discuss higher limits to meet your needs. You will recieve an HTTP 429 response code if you reach the limit cap.

Large 80: A100 GPU with 80GB memory @ $0.00145 per second (~$5.20 per hour)
Large 40: A100 GPU with 40GB memory @ $0.00114 per second (~$4.10 per hour)

Small: T4 GPU with 16GB memory @ $0.00011 per second (~$0.40 per hour)

Billing is by the second of compute usage, starting at the time when the endpoint is ready for inferences. The time when the endpoint is ready for inferences is when either the healtcheck on your end point begins returning 200, or if there is no healthcheck, the time you see the “Replica is running” log line in your events tab.

You will be billed for the total inference duration and timeout duration
You will not be billed for the duration of cold start

Example models in the platform have a pre-set hardware / pricing tier. If you create an endpoint from a custom model, you can choose the tier best suited to your needs.",

Input Parameters

model (string): The model to be used for chat completion. Here is the complete list of presently supported model arguments. For more information regarding these models, see this description.

  "llama-2-13b-chat",
  "llama-2-70b-chat",
  "codellama-7b-instruct",
  "codellama-13b-instruct",
  "codellama-34b-instruct",
  "mistral-7b-instruct"
  "mixtral-8x7b-instruct"
  "nous-hermes-2-mixtral-8x7b-dpo"
  "hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b"


max_tokens (integer, optional): The maximum number of tokens to generate for the chat completion.
messages (list of objects): A list of chat messages, where each message is an object with properties: role and content. Supported roles are “system”, “assistant”, and “user”.
temperature (float, optional): A value between 0.0 and 2.0 that controls the randomness of the model's output.
top_p (float, optional): A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls the probability of the model generating a particular token.
stop (list of strings, optional): A list of strings that the model will stop generating text if it encounters any of them.
frequency_penalty (float, optional): A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls how much the model penalizes generating repetitive responses.
presence_penalty (float, optional): A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls how much the model penalizes generating responses that contain certain words or phrases.
stream (boolean, optional): Indicates whether the response should be streamed.

Streaming Response Sample:
Once parsed to JSON, you will see the content of the streaming response similar to below:
// Starting chunk, note that content is null and finish_reason is also null.
{
  "id":"cmpl-994f6307a891454cb0f57b7027f5f113",

      {
        "role":"assistant",
        "content":null
      },
      "finish_reason":null
    }
  ]
}
// Ending chunk, note the finish_reason "length" instead of null.
// This means we reached the max tokens allowed in this request.
// The "object" field is "chat.completion.chunk" for the body of responses.
{
  "id":"cmpl-994f6307a891454cb0f57b7027f5f113",

        "content":"",
        "function_call":null
      },
      "finish_reason":"length"
    }
  ]
}

In this example, we will show you how to change just three lines of code to make your Python application use OctoAI's Open Source models through OpenAI's Python SDK.
What you will build
Migrate OpenAI's Python SDK example script to use OctoAI's LLM endpoints.
These are the three modifications necessary to achieve our goal:

Redefine OPENAI_API_KEY your API key environment variable to use your OctoAI key.
Redefine OPENAI_BASE_URL to point to https://text.octoai.run/v1
Change the model name to an Open Source model, for example: llama-2-13b-chat

Requirements
We will be using Python and OpenAI's Python SDK.
Instructions

Set up a Python virtual environment. Read Creating Virtual Environments here.

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate


Install the pip requirements in your local python virtual environment

python3 -m pip install openai

Environment setup
To run this example, there are simple steps to take:

Get an OctoAI API token by following these instructions.
Expose the token in a new OCTOAI_TOKEN environment variable:

export OCTOAI_TOKEN=<your-token>


Switch the OpenAI token and base URL environment variable

export OPENAI_API_KEY=$OCTOAI_TOKEN
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://text.octoai.run/v1"

If you prefer, you can also directly paste your token into the client initialization.
Example code
Once you've completed the steps above, the code below will call OctoAI LLMs:
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

completion = octoai.text_gen.create_chat_completion(
    # model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    model="llama-2-13b-chat",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)

Note that you need to supply one of OctoAI's supported LLMs as an argument, as in the example above. For a complete list of our supported LLMs, check out our REST API page.
Example output
The code above produces the following object:

ChatCompletionMessage(content="  Hello! How can I assist you today? Do you have any questions or tasks you'd like help with? Please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.", role='assistant' function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Image Generation Arguments

prompt: A string describing the image to generate.

We currently have a 77 token limit on prompts for SDXL and 231 for SD 1.5
You can use prompt weighting, e.g. (A tall (beautiful:1.5) woman:1.0) (some other prompt with weight:0.8) . The weight will be the product of all brackets a token is a member of. The brackets, colons and weights do not count towards the number of tokens.


prompt_2: This only applies to SDXL. By default, setting only prompt copies the input to both prompt and prompt_2. When prompt and prompt_2 are both set, they have very different functionality. The second prompt is meant for more human readable descriptions of the desired image.

For example, prompt is used for "word salad" style control of the image. This is the type of prompting you are likely familiar with from SD 1.5. Prompts like the following work well:
prompt = "photorealistic, high definition, masterpiece, sharp lines"   
whereas prompt_2 is meant for more human readable descriptions of the desired image. For example:
prompt_2 = "A portrait of a handsome cat wearing a little hat. The cat is in front of a colorful background.   


negative_prompt Optional: A string indicating a prompt for guidance to steer away from. Unused when not provided.
negative_prompt_2: This only applies to SDXL. This prompt is meant for human readable descriptions of what you don’t want the image, e.g. you would say “Low resolution” in negative_prompt then “Bad hands” in negative_prompt_2.
sampler Optional: A string specifying which scheduler to use when generating an image. Defaults to DDIM. Regular samplers include DDIM,DDPM,DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS,DPM_SINGLE,DPM_SOLVER_MULTISTEP,K_EULER, K_EULER_ANCESTRAL,PNDM,UNI_PC. Premium samplers (2x price) include DPM_2, DPM_2_ANCESTRAL,DPM_PLUS_PLUS_SDE_KARRAS, HEUN and KLMS.
height Optional: An integer specifying the height of the output image. Defaults to 1024 for SDXL and 512 for SD 1.5.
width Optional: An integer specifying the width of the output image. Defaults to 1024 for SDXL and 512 for SD 1.5.

Supported Output Resolutions (Width x Height) are as follows:
For SDXL:
(1024, 1024),(896, 1152),(832, 1216),(768,
1344),(640, 1536),(1536, 640),(1344, 768),
(1216, 832),(1152, 896)

For SD1.5
(512, 512),(640, 512),(768, 512),(512, 704),
(512, 768),(576, 768),(640, 768),(576, 1024),
(1024, 576)

init_image and mask_image will be resized to the specified resolution
before applying img2img or inpainting.

cfg_scale Optional: How strictly the diffusion process adheres to the prompt text (higher values keep your image closer to your prompt). When not set defaults to 12.
steps Optional: How many steps of diffusion to perform. The higher this is, the higher the image clarity will be but proportionally increases the runtime. Defaults to 30 when not set.
num_images: An integer describing the number of images to generate. Defaults to 1
seed Optional: An integer that fixes the random noise of the model. Using the same seed guarantees the same output image, which can be useful for testing or replication. Use null to select a random seed.
use_refiner: This only applies to SDXL. A boolean true or false determines whether to use the refiner or not
high_noise_frac Optional: This only applies to SDXL. A floating point or integer determining how much noise should be applied using the base model vs. the refiner. A value of 0.8 will apply the base model at 80% and Refiner at 20%. Defaults to 0.8 when not set.
checkpoint: Here you can specify a checkpoint either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. Note that using a custom asset increases generation time.
loras: Here you can specify LoRAs, in name-weight pairs, either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. Note that using a custom asset increases generation time.

init_image Optional: Only applicable for Img2Img and inpainting use cases i.e. to use an image as a starting point for image generation. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
Use .jpg format to ensure best latency 


strength Optional: Only applicable for img2img use cases. A floating point or integer determines how much noise should be applied. Values that approach 1.0 allow for high variation i.e. ignoring the image entirely, but will also produce images that are not semantically consistent with the input and 0.0 keeps the input image as-is. Defaults to 0.8 when not set.


mask_image Optional: Only applicable for inpainting use cases i.e. to specify which area of the picture to paint onto. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.

Use .jpg format to ensure best latency



outpainting Optional: Only applicable for outpainting use cases. Argument takes a boolean value to determine Whether the request requires outpainting or not. If so, special preprocessing is applied for better results. Defaults to false


transfer_images Optional: This is our Photo Merge feature. Applicable for use cases where you wish to transfer the subject in the uploaded image(s) to the output image(s). Argument takes a dictionary containing a mapping of trigger words to a list of sample images which demonstrate the desired object to transfer.


payload = {
    ...
        "prompt": "A trigger_word_1 sitting on a golden throne",
        "negative_prompt": "Blurry photo, distortion, low-res, bad quality",

        "transfer_images": {"trigger_word_1": ["$BASE64_IMAGE_1", "$BASE64_IMAGE_2"]
    ...
}



controlnet Optional: Required if using a controlnet engine. Argument takes in the value of ControlNet to be used during image generation. We offer the following list of public OctoAI controlnet checkpoints in the OctoAI Asset Library.
octoai:canny_sdxl
octoai:depth_sdxl
octoai:openpose_sdxl
octoai:canny_sd15

octoai:ip2p_sd15
octoai:lineart_sd15
octoai:openpose_sd15
octoai:scribble_sd15
octoai:tile_sd15

Other than using the default controlnet checkpoints, you can also upload private ControlNet checkpoints into the OctoAI Asset Library and then use those checkpoints at generation time via the parameter controlnet. For custom controlnet checkpoints, make sure to provide your own ControlNet mask in the controlnet_image parameter


controlnet_conditioning_scale Optional: Only applicable if using Controlnets. Argument determines how strong the effect of the controlnet will be. Defaults to 1


controlnet_early_stop Optional:Only applicable if using Controlnets. If provided, indicates fraction of steps at which to stop applying controlnet. This can be used to sometimes generate better outputs.


controlnet_image Optional: Required if using a controlnet engine. Controlnet image encoded in b64 string for guiding image generation.


controlnet_preprocess Optional:Only applicable if using Controlnets. Argument takes in a boolean value to determine whether or not to apply automatic ControlNet preprocessing. For the privileged set of controlnet checkpoints listed above, we default to helping you autogenerate the corresponding controlnet map/mask that will be fed into the controlnet, but you can override the default by additionally specifying a controlnet_preprocess: false parameter.

prompt: A string describing the image to generate.

We currently have a 77 token limit on prompts for SDXL and 231 for SD 1.5
You can use prompt weighting, e.g. (A tall (beautiful:1.5) woman:1.0) (some other prompt with weight:0.8) . The weight will be the product of all brackets a token is a member of. The brackets, colons and weights do not count towards the number of tokens.


prompt_2: This only applies to SDXL. By default, setting only prompt copies the input to both prompt and prompt_2. When prompt and prompt_2 are both set, they have very different functionality. The second prompt is meant for more human readable descriptions of the desired image.

For example, prompt is used for "word salad" style control of the image. This is the type of prompting you are likely familiar with from SD 1.5. Prompts like the following work well:
prompt = "photorealistic, high definition, masterpiece, sharp lines"   
whereas prompt_2 is meant for more human readable descriptions of the desired image. For example:
prompt_2 = "A portrait of a handsome cat wearing a little hat. The cat is in front of a colorful background.   


negative_prompt Optional: A string indicating a prompt for guidance to steer away from. Unused when not provided.
negative_prompt_2: This only applies to SDXL. This prompt is meant for human readable descriptions of what you don’t want the image, e.g. you would say “Low resolution” in negative_prompt then “Bad hands” in negative_prompt_2.
sampler Optional: A string specifying which scheduler to use when generating an image. Defaults to DDIM. Regular samplers include DDIM,DDPM,DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS,DPM_SINGLE,DPM_SOLVER_MULTISTEP,K_EULER, K_EULER_ANCESTRAL,PNDM,UNI_PC. Premium samplers (2x price) include DPM_2, DPM_2_ANCESTRAL,DPM_PLUS_PLUS_SDE_KARRAS, HEUN and KLMS.
height Optional: An integer specifying the height of the output image. Defaults to 1024 for SDXL and 512 for SD 1.5.
width Optional: An integer specifying the width of the output image. Defaults to 1024 for SDXL and 512 for SD 1.5.

Supported Output Resolutions (Width x Height) are as follows:
For SDXL:
(1024, 1024),(896, 1152),(832, 1216),(768,
1344),(640, 1536),(1536, 640),(1344, 768),
(1216, 832),(1152, 896)

For SD1.5
(512, 512),(640, 512),(768, 512),(512, 704),
(512, 768),(576, 768),(640, 768),(576, 1024),
(1024, 576)

init_image and mask_image will be resized to the specified resolution
before applying img2img or inpainting.

cfg_scale Optional: How strictly the diffusion process adheres to the prompt text (higher values keep your image closer to your prompt). When not set defaults to 12.
steps Optional: How many steps of diffusion to perform. The higher this is, the higher the image clarity will be but proportionally increases the runtime. Defaults to 30 when not set.
num_images: An integer describing the number of images to generate. Defaults to 1
seed Optional: An integer that fixes the random noise of the model. Using the same seed guarantees the same output image, which can be useful for testing or replication. Use null to select a random seed.
use_refiner: This only applies to SDXL. A boolean true or false determines whether to use the refiner or not
high_noise_frac Optional: This only applies to SDXL. A floating point or integer determining how much noise should be applied using the base model vs. the refiner. A value of 0.8 will apply the base model at 80% and Refiner at 20%. Defaults to 0.8 when not set.
checkpoint: Here you can specify a checkpoint either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. Note that using a custom asset increases generation time.
loras: Here you can specify LoRAs, in name-weight pairs, either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. Note that using a custom asset increases generation time.
textual_inversions: Here you can specify textual inversions and their corresponding trigger words. Note that using a custom asset increases generation time.

Values that approach 1.0 allow for high variation i.e. ignoring the image entirely, but will also produce images that are not semantically consistent with the input and 0.0 keeps the input image as-is. Defaults to 0.8 when not set.


mask_image Optional: Only applicable for inpainting use cases i.e. to specify which area of the picture to paint onto. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.

Use .jpg format to ensure best latency



outpainting Optional: Only applicable for outpainting use cases. Argument takes a boolean value to determine Whether the request requires outpainting or not. If so, special preprocessing is applied for better results. Defaults to false


transfer_images Optional: This is our Photo Merge feature. Applicable for use cases where you wish to transfer the subject in the uploaded image(s) to the output image(s). Argument takes a dictionary containing a mapping of trigger words to a list of sample images which demonstrate the desired object to transfer.


payload = {
    ...
        "prompt": "A trigger_word_1 sitting on a golden throne",
        "negative_prompt": "Blurry photo, distortion, low-res, bad quality",
        "checkpoint": "octoai:RealVisXL",

        "transfer_images": {"trigger_word_1": ["$BASE64_IMAGE_1", "$BASE64_IMAGE_2"]
    ...
}



controlnet Optional: Required if using a controlnet engine. Argument takes in the value of ControlNet to be used during image generation. We offer the following list of public OctoAI controlnet checkpoints in the OctoAI Asset Library.
octoai:canny_sdxl
octoai:depth_sdxl
octoai:openpose_sdxl
octoai:canny_sd15
octoai:depth_sd15
octoai:inpaint_sd15
octoai:ip2p_sd15
octoai:lineart_sd15
octoai:openpose_sd15
octoai:scribble_sd15
octoai:tile_sd15

Other than using the default controlnet checkpoints, you can also upload private ControlNet checkpoints into the OctoAI Asset Library and then use those checkpoints at generation time via the parameter controlnet. For custom controlnet checkpoints, make sure to provide your own ControlNet mask in the controlnet_image parameter


controlnet_conditioning_scale Optional: Only applicable if using Controlnets. Argument determines how strong the effect of the controlnet will be. Defaults to 1


controlnet_early_stop Optional:Only applicable if using Controlnets. If provided, indicates fraction of steps at which to stop applying controlnet. This can be used to sometimes generate better outputs.


controlnet_image Optional: Required if using a controlnet engine. Controlnet image encoded in b64 string for guiding image generation.


controlnet_preprocess Optional:Only applicable if using Controlnets. Argument takes in a boolean value to determine whether or not to apply automatic ControlNet preprocessing. For the privileged set of controlnet checkpoints listed above, we default to helping you autogenerate the corresponding controlnet map/mask that will be fed into the controlnet, but you can override the default by additionally specifying a controlnet_preprocess: false parameter.

Request payload
Parameters:


init_image (str, required) - A base64-encoded image. Resolution must be supported by inpainting_base_model:
sdxl:  640x1536, 768x1344, 832x1216, 896x1152, 1024x1024, 1152x896, 1216x832, 1344x768, 1536x640, 1664x2432, 2048x2048, 2432x1664
sd15: 384x704, 448x576, 512x512, 512x704, 512x768, 512x832, 576x448, 576x768, 576x768, 576x1024, 640x512, 640x640, 640x768, 704x384, 704x1216, 768x512, 768x576, 768x1024, 832x512, 896x896, 1024x576, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1024x1536, 1216x704, 1536x1024


init_image_url (string, required if init_image not specified) - If given, download init_image from this URL.


detector (str,required) - Detection model to use. Configures whether e.g. faces or hands or people are targeted for after-detailing.
Available options: face_yolov8n, hand_yolov8n, face_full_mediapipe, face_short_mediapipe, face_mesh_mediapipe, eyes_mesh_mediapipe 


inpainting_base_model (str, required) -
The base model to be used for inpainting. Typically should match the model used to generate init_image.
Available options: sdxl, sd15 


cfg_scale (number,optional default: 7.5)-
Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to prompt description. Must be a positive number no greater than 50.0.


checkpoint(string, optional)-  Name of a checkpoint to use for inpainting.


confidence (number,optional, default: 0.3) -
Inpainted areas are determined using a detector. This setting adjusts the sensitivity of the detector (lower considers more image fragments for inpainting).


image_encoding (string,optional)-
Define which encoding process should be applied before returning the modified image.
Available options: jpeg, png 


loras (object | optional) - A dict mapping the name of a LoRA to apply to its weight.


mask_blur (integer, optional,default: 4) - A mask is created for each inpainted area in the image. After dilation (see mask_dilation parameter), the mask is blurred. This technique is typically used to smoothly blend the inpainted area with the original image. This option specifies the radius, in pixels, of the gaussian blur kernel. The higher the value, the wider the blur. Defaults to 4. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 64.


mask_dilation (integer,optional,default: 4) - A mask is created for each inpainted area in the image. Mask Dilation allows you to expand the size of the mask while maintaining its shape. This technique is typically used to reduce artifacts near borders in the mask. This parameter is the size, in pixels, of the dilation kernel to apply. Defaults to 4. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 64.


mask_padding (integer,optional,default: 32) -\ Each inpainted area is passed to the image-to-image generator with some surrounding context. The contextual area is created by padding the area occupied by the blurred, dilated mask. This technique improves inpainting quality, and the contextual area is not modified. This parameter specifies the amount of padding, in pixels, to apply around the processed mask. When the computed padding goes off the edge of the image, the padded area is slid towards the center of the image. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 10% the size of an inpainting mask.


max_num_detections (integer,optional) - Inpaint at most this many objects, starting with the most confident matches.


negative_prompt (string,optional)


prompt (string | optional)


sampler (string | optional) - The schedulers available for image generation.
Available options: PNDM, LMS, KLMS, DDIM, DDPM, HEUN, K_HEUN, K_EULER, K_EULER_ANCESTRAL, DPM_SOLVER_MULTISTEP, DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS, DPM_SINGLE, DPM_2, DPM_2_ANCESTRAL, DPM_PLUS_PLUS_SDE_KARRAS, UNI_PC,LCM


seed (integer,optional) - Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.


steps (integer, optional,default: 20)


strength (number,optional, default 0.9`)


style_preset(string,optional,default: base)


union_masks (boolean, optional,default: false) - When true, create a single mask by unioning the mask for each detected object together, then send a single inpainting request to the backing model.


use_refiner (boolean,optional,default: false)


Response


image_b64 (string) - The modified image or None if it was removed for safety.


num_objects_detected (integer) - The number of objects that were successfully detected.


num_objects_inpainted (integer) - The number of objects that were successfully inpainted.


num_removed_for_safety (integer) - Number of inpainting requests that violated the OctoAI Terms of Service.

Available options: face_yolov8n, hand_yolov8n, face_full_mediapipe, face_short_mediapipe, face_mesh_mediapipe, eyes_mesh_mediapipe 


inpainting_base_model (str, required) -
The base model to be used for inpainting. Typically should match the model used to generate init_image.
Available options: sdxl, sd15 


cfg_scale (number,optional default: 7.5)-
Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to prompt description. Must be a positive number no greater than 50.0.


checkpoint(string, optional)-  Name of a checkpoint to use for inpainting.


confidence (number,optional, default: 0.3) -
Inpainted areas are determined using a detector. This setting adjusts the sensitivity of the detector (lower considers more image fragments for inpainting).


image_encoding (string,optional)-
Define which encoding process should be applied before returning the modified image.
Available options: jpeg, png 


loras (object | optional) - A dict mapping the name of a LoRA to apply to its weight.


mask_blur (integer, optional,default: 4) - A mask is created for each inpainted area in the image. After dilation (see mask_dilation parameter), the mask is blurred. This technique is typically used to smoothly blend the inpainted area with the original image. This option specifies the radius, in pixels, of the gaussian blur kernel. The higher the value, the wider the blur. Defaults to 4. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 64.


mask_dilation (integer,optional,default: 4) - A mask is created for each inpainted area in the image. Mask Dilation allows you to expand the size of the mask while maintaining its shape. This technique is typically used to reduce artifacts near borders in the mask. This parameter is the size, in pixels, of the dilation kernel to apply. Defaults to 4. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 64.


mask_padding (integer,optional,default: 32) -\ Each inpainted area is passed to the image-to-image generator with some surrounding context. The contextual area is created by padding the area occupied by the blurred, dilated mask. This technique improves inpainting quality, and the contextual area is not modified. This parameter specifies the amount of padding, in pixels, to apply around the processed mask. When the computed padding goes off the edge of the image, the padded area is slid towards the center of the image. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 10% the size of an inpainting mask.


max_num_detections (integer,optional) - Inpaint at most this many objects, starting with the most confident matches.


negative_prompt (string,optional)


prompt (string | optional)


sampler (string | optional) - The schedulers available for image generation.
Available options: PNDM, LMS, KLMS, DDIM, DDPM, HEUN, K_HEUN, K_EULER, K_EULER_ANCESTRAL, DPM_SOLVER_MULTISTEP, DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS, DPM_SINGLE, DPM_2, DPM_2_ANCESTRAL, DPM_PLUS_PLUS_SDE_KARRAS, UNI_PC,LCM


seed (integer,optional) - Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.


steps (integer, optional,default: 20)


strength (number,optional, default 0.9`)


style_preset(string,optional,default: base)


union_masks (boolean, optional,default: false) - When true, create a single mask by unioning the mask for each detected object together, then send a single inpainting request to the backing model.


use_refiner (boolean,optional,default: false)

Self-Service Models
We are always expanding our offering of models and other features. Presently, OctoAI supports the following models & checkpoints for self-service models:
Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2: Updated by Mistral AI in December 2023, this model has impressed the LLM community with its high-quality performance at a very low parameter count. This model is available for commercial use. Read more. We offer a single endpoint here: the 7B parameter model, which supports up to 32,768 tokens. Note that Mistral's model does not have any moderation mechanisms. For more sensitive use cases, we recommend using Llama2 and Codellama endpoints.
Mistral-8x7b-Instruct: Mistral AI's December 2023 release, Mistral-8x7b-Instruct, is a "mixture of experts" model utilizing conditional computing for efficient token generation, reducing computational demands while improving response quality (GPT-4 is widely believed to be an MoE model). Mistral-8x7b-Instruct brings these efficiencies to the open-source LLM realm, and it is licensed for commercial use. It supports up to 32,768 tokens. Read more. Note: As with Mistral-7B-Instruct, Mixtral lacks moderation mechanisms. For sensitive applications, consider Llama2 or Codellama endpoints.
Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7b-DPO The flagship Nous Research model trained over the Mixtral 8x7B MoE LLM. The model was trained on over 1,000,000 entries of data, as well as other high quality data from open datasets across the AI landscape, achieving state of the art performance on a variety of tasks. It supports up to 32,768 tokens.
Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7b An upgraded, retrained version of Nous Hermes 2 Mistral 7B, consisting of an updated and cleaned version of the OpenHermes 2.5 Dataset. It is especially good at JSON schema following. It supports up to 32,768 tokens. Read more about how to use schema following here.
Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct coming soon!
Mixtral 8x22B (fine-tune) With the recent release of Mixtral 8x22B base model, new fine tunes are emerging from the community at a rapid rate. We will be using this particular endpoint to trying ou the best community fine tunes as they become available, meaning this model will change and serve as a testing grounds for our users. Check back frequently to see which new fine tune is available. After thorough testing we will select the top performing fine tune to persistantly host on OctoAI.
Llama2-Chat: Released by Meta in July 2023, this auto-regressive language model uses an optimized transformer architecture. This model is available for commercial use. The "Chat" versions that OctoAI hosts by default utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety. Read more. OctoAI offers this model in 13- and 70-billion parameter sizes. Our quality testing has indicated that the 7 billion parameter variant does not meet competitive quality standards. All checkpoints of this model hosted by OctoAI are limited to a max token length of 4,096.
Codellama-Instruct: Released by Meta in August 2023, this model builds upon the Llama2 architecture but offers specialized support for coding and other structured tasks. This model is available for commercial use. We host the "Instruct" variant, optimized for instruction following and safer deployment. Read more. We support 7-, 13-,and -34 billion parameter variants. Other variants, including the Python checkpoints and 70B variants, are available upon request. All endpoints support up to 16,384 tokens.
Llama Guard: A 7B content moderation model released by Meta, which can classify text as safe or unsafe according to an editable set of policies. As a 7B parameter model, it is optimized for latency and can be used to moderate other LLM interactions in real time. Read more. Note: This model requires a specific prompt template to be applied, and is not compatible with the ChatCompletion API.
GTE Large An embeddings model released by Alibaba DAMO Academy. Trained on a large-scale corpus of relevance text pairs, covering a wide range of domains and scenarios. Consistently ranked highly on Huggingface's MTEB leaderboard. In combination with a vector database, this embeddings model is especially useful for powering semantic search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Read more.
For pricing of all of these endpoints, please refer to our pricing page.
Web UI playground
You can start familiarizing yourself with our Text Gen features using the web UI, but note that we have even more features available via the API.
First, click on the top navigation bar and click Text Tools. Here you will see the different model families that we offer for self-service users:

Click the Demo or API selections to enter our playground, where you can:

Easily switch between all of our models, parameter counts, and quantization settings
Test each model using our chat interface
Adjust common settings such as temperature
See the pricing and context limits for any selected model.


Selecting the "API" toggle will show you code samples in Python, TypeScript, and CURL format for calling the endpoint that you've selected, as well as key input & output parameters:

Billing
For pricing of all of these endpoints, please refer to our pricing page.
Once you provide billing information and generate an API key, any usage of these endpoints will be viewable under Accounts -> Billing & Usage -> Text Generation Usage. Note that these endpoints are very price competitive, so you'll generally needs to rack up tens of thousands of tokens before you can see the charges!

Requirements

Please create an OctoAI API token if you don't have one already.
Please also verify you've completed Python SDK Installation & Setup.

If you use the OCTOAI_TOKEN envvar for your token, you can instantiate the OctoAI client with octoai = OctoAI() after importing the octoai package.



Text Generation
The following snippet shows you how to use the Chat Completions API to generate text using Llama2.
import json

from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.text_gen import ChatMessage

client = OctoAI()
completion = client.text_gen.create_chat_completion(
    model="llama-2-70b-chat",
    messages=[
        ChatMessage(
            role="system",
            content="Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.",
        ),
        ChatMessage(role="user", content="Write a blog about Seattle"),
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
)

print(json.dumps(completion.dict(), indent=2))

The response is of type octoai.text_gen.ChatCompletionResponse. If you print the response from this call as in the example above, it looks similar to the following:

  }
}

Note that billing is based upon "prompt tokens" and "completion tokens" above. View prices on our pricing page.
Streaming Responses
The following snippet shows you how to obtain the model's response incrementally as it is generated using streaming (using stream=True).
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.text_gen import ChatMessage

client = OctoAI()
for completion in client.text_gen.create_chat_completion_stream(
    model="llama-2-70b-chat",
    messages=[
        ChatMessage(
            role="system",
            content="Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.",
        ),
        ChatMessage(role="user", content="Write a blog about Seattle"),
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
):
    print(completion.choices[0].delta.content, end='', flush=True)


When using streaming mode, the response is of type Iterable[ChatCompletionChunk]. To read each incremental response from the model, you can use a for loop over the returned object. The example above prints each incremental response as it arrives, and they accumulate to form the entire response in the output as the model prediction progresses.

This guide will walk you through how to use the TypeScript SDK to call our Text Gen API. The TypeScript SDK supports streaming and non-streaming inferences for both the Chat Completions API and legacy Completions API. There are also additional parameters such as frequencyPenalty, maxTokens, presencePenalty, etc. that can be used for finer control.
Requirements

Please create an OctoAI API token if you don't have one already.
Please also verify you've completed TypeScript SDK Installation & Setup.

If you use the OCTOAI_TOKEN envvar for your token, you can instantiate the client with octoai = new OctoAIClient(), otherwise you will need to pass an API token using: octoai = new OctoAIClient({ apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN })



Chat Completions API
Non-Streaming Example
To make a chat completions call, you will need to provide the model you wish to call and a list of chat messages.
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
});

const result = await octoai.textGen.createChatCompletion({
  model: "meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a helpful assistant. Keep your responses limited to one short paragraph if possible.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Write a blog about Seattle",
    },
  ],
});

console.log(result.choices[0].message.content);
// "Seattle is a vibrant and eclectic city..."

Streaming Example
The above example can work great in some scenarios, but if you're dealing with larger requests or are building a highly-interactive user experience, using the streaming interface may be a better choice. The available options between non-streaming and streaming inferences are identical, but there are two main code changes needed:

You will need to use the createChatCompletionStream() method instead of createChatCompletion().
Instead of grabbing the final text message from the response, you will need to loop over the individual chunks and concatenate the tokens.

import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
});

const stream = await octoai.textGen.createChatCompletionStream({
  model: "meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a helpful assistant. Keep your responses limited to one short paragraph if possible.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Write a blog about Seattle",
    },
  ],
});

let result = "";

// Loops over the returned chunks whenever they're ready
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  // The content of the first chunk can be `undefined`
  result += chunk.choices[0].delta.content ?? "";
}

console.log(result);
// "Seattle is a vibrant and eclectic city..."

Completions API
The TypeScript SDK also supports the legacy Completions API with the same customization options as the Chat Completions API. The key difference between the two is that you provide a prompt string instead of a list of chat message objects. Much like the Chat Completions API, you can choose between non-streaming and streaming inference.
Non-Streaming Example
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
});

const response = await octoai.textGen.createCompletion({
  model: "meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
  prompt: "Write a blog about Seattle",
});

console.log(response.choices[0].text);
// "Seattle is a vibrant and eclectic city..."

Streaming Example
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
});

const stream = await octoai.textGen.createCompletionStream({
  model: "meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
  prompt: "Write a blog about Seattle",
});

let result = "";

// Loops over the returned chunks whenever they're ready
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  result += chunk.choices[0].text;
}

console.log(result);
// "Seattle is a vibrant and eclectic city..."

Curl example (Mistral-7B): Let's say that you want to ensure that your LLM responses format user feedback about cars into a usable JSON format.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "the car was black and it was a toyota camry."
            }
        ],

        "response_format": {

        }
    }'

The LLM will respond in the exact schema specified:
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-d5d81b7c80b249ea8177f95f68a51d8e",
  "object": "chat.completion",

  }
}

Pydantic and OctoAI's Python SDK
Pydantic is a popular Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. By combining Pydantic with the OctoAI SDK, you can easily define the desired JSON schema for your LLM responses and ensure that the generated content adheres to that structure.
First, make sure you have the required packages installed:
python3 -m pip install openai pydantic==2.5.3

Basic example
Let's start with a basic example to demonstrate how Pydantic and the OctoAI SDK work together. In this example, we'll define a simple Car model with color and maker attributes, and ask the LLM to generate a response that fits this schema.
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.text_gen import ChatCompletionResponseFormat, ChatMessage
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

client = OctoAI()

class Car(BaseModel):
    color: str
    maker: str

completion = client.text_gen.create_chat_completion(
    model="mistral-7b-instruct",
    messages=[
        ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage(role="user", content="the car was black and it was a toyota camry."),
    ],
    max_tokens=512,
    presence_penalty=0,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
    response_format=ChatCompletionResponseFormat(
        type="json_object",
        schema=Car.model_json_schema(),
    ),
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

The key points to note here are:


We import the necessary classes from the OctoAI SDK: Client, TextModel, and ChatCompletionResponseFormat.


We define a Car class inheriting from BaseModel, specifying the color and maker attributes with their expected types.


When creating the chat completion, we set the response_format using ChatCompletionResponseFormat and include the JSON schema generated from our Car model using Car.model_json_schema().


The output will be a JSON object adhering to the specified schema:
{ "color": "black", "maker": "Toyota" }

Array example
Next, let's look at an example involving arrays. Suppose we want the LLM to generate a list of names based on a given prompt. We can define a Meeting model with a names attribute of type List[str].
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.text_gen import ChatCompletionResponseFormat, ChatMessage
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

client = OctoAI()

class Meeting(BaseModel):
    names: List[str]


chat_completion = client.text_gen.create_chat_completion(
    model="<model>",
    messages=[
        ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage(role="user", content="John and Jane meet the day after"),
    ],
    temperature=0,
    response_format=ChatCompletionResponseFormat(
        type="json_object",
        schema=Meeting.model_json_schema()
    ),
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)

The LLM will generate a response containing an array of names:
{ "names": ["John", "Jane"] }

Nested example
Finally, let's explore a more complex example involving nested models. In this case, we'll define a Person model with name and age attributes, and a Result model containing a sorted list of Person objects.
class Person(BaseModel):
    """The object representing a person with name and age"""

    name: str = Field(description="Name of the person")
    age: int = Field(description="The age of the person")


class Result(BaseModel):
    """The format of the answer."""

    sorted_list: List[Person] = Field(description="List of the sorted objects")


completion = octoai.text_gen.create_chat_completion(
    model="mistral-7b-instruct",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Alice is 10 years old, Bob is 7 and carol is 2. Sort them by age in ascending order.",
        },
    ],
    max_tokens=512,
    presence_penalty=0,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
    response_format=ChatCompletionResponseFormat(
        type="json_object",
        schema=Result.model_json_schema(),
    ),
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

In this example:

We define a Person model with name and age attributes, along with descriptions using the Field function from Pydantic.
We define a Result model containing a sorted_list attribute of type List[Person].
When creating the chat completion, we set the response_format using ChatCompletionResponseFormat and include the JSON schema generated from our Result model.

The LLM will generate a response containing a sorted list of Person objects:
{
  "sorted_list": [
    { "name": "Carol", "age": 2 },
    { "name": "Bob", "age": 7 },
    { "name": "Alice", "age": 10 }
  ]
}

Instructor
Instructor makes it easy to reliably get structured data like JSON from Large Language Models (LLMs). Read more here
Install
python3 -m pip install instructor

Example
import os
import openai
from pydantic import BaseModel
import instructor

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://text.octoai.run/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["OCTOAI_TOKEN"],
)


# By default, the patch function will patch the ChatCompletion.create and ChatCompletion.create methods to support the response_model parameter
client = instructor.patch(client, mode=instructor.Mode.JSON_SCHEMA)


# Now, we can use the response_model parameter using only a base model
# rather than having to use the OpenAISchema class
class UserExtract(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


user: UserExtract = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="mistral-7b-instruct",
    response_model=UserExtract,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract jason is 25 years old"},
    ],
)

print(user.model_dump_json(indent=2))

Let's break down the code step by step:
After importing the necessary modules and setting the clients, we:


We use the instructor.patch function to patch the ChatCompletion.create method of the OctoAI client. This allows us to use the response_model parameter directly with a Pydantic model.


We define a Pydantic model called UserExtract that represents the desired structure of the extracted user information. In this case, it has two fields: name (a string) and age (an integer).


We call the chat.completions.create method of the patched OctoAI client, specifying the model (mistral-7b-instruct), the response_model (our UserExtract model), and the user message that contains the information we want to extract.


Finally, we print the extracted user information using the model_dump_json method, which serializes the Pydantic model to a JSON string with indentation for better readability.


The output will be a JSON object containing the extracted user information, adhering to the specified UserExtract schema:
{
  "name": "jason",
  "age": 25
}

By leveraging Instructor and the OctoAI SDK, you can easily define the desired output schema and ensure that the LLM generates structured data that fits your application's requirements. This simplifies the process of integrating LLM-generated content into your software systems.",

We define a Pydantic model called UserExtract that represents the desired structure of the extracted user information. In this case, it has two fields: name (a string) and age (an integer).


We call the chat.completions.create method of the patched OctoAI client, specifying the model (mistral-7b-instruct), the response_model (our UserExtract model), and the user message that contains the information we want to extract.


Finally, we print the extracted user information using the model_dump_json method, which serializes the Pydantic model to a JSON string with indentation for better readability.


The output will be a JSON object containing the extracted user information, adhering to the specified UserExtract schema:

LlamaGuard is a 7B parameter LLM designed for moderating content in Human-AI interactions, able to focus on safety risks in both prompts and responses.
Built on the Llama2-7B architecture, it utilizes a safety risk taxonomy for categorizing various types of content risks. This taxonomy aids in the classification of LLM prompts and responses, ensuring that conversations remain within safe boundaries. The model has been fine-tuned on a specially curated dataset, showing strong performance on benchmarks like the OpenAI Moderation Evaluation dataset and ToxicChat, often outperforming existing content moderation tools.
LlamaGuard7B operates by performing multi-class classification and generating binary decision scores, making it a versatile tool for managing content safety across various conversational AI applications. Its instruction fine-tuning feature allows for task customization and adaptation of output formats, making it adaptable to a range of use cases by adjusting taxonomy categories as needed.
Prompt Template
LlamaGuard requires a very specific prompt template to function properly. Effective use/customization of LLamaGuard requires understanding this template. Here is a helpful illustration from Meta's paper on the subject:

Let's go ahead and try this out on OctoAI.  First, let's configure our OctoAI API token:
token = 'foo'

Now, let's set up the prompt template:
import os
from string import Template

import requests

B_INST, E_INST = "[INST]", "[/INST]"

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = Template(
    f"""Task: Check if there is unsafe content in '$agent_type' messages in conversations according our safety policy with the below categories.

def format_prompt(role, message):
    prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.substitute(prompt=message, agent_type=role)
    prompt = f"<s>{B_INST} {prompt.strip()} {E_INST}"
    return prompt


Finally, let's call the model with one normal prompt and one toxic prompt:
for prompt in [
    "User: Can you recommend a savory pasta recipe?",
    "User: How can I make crystal meth?",
]:
    response = requests.post(
        "https://text.octoai.run/v1/completions",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
        json={
            "model": "llamaguard-7b",
            "prompt": format_prompt("User", prompt), #Submit the prompt and specify the role as "user" for this exercise
            "max_tokens": 100,
            "top_p": 0.9,
            "temperature": 0,
        },
    )
    json = response.json()
    print(json['choices'])

Below, we can see LLama Guard's response from the two prompts submitted:
[{'finish_reason': 'stop', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'text': ' safe'}]
[{'finish_reason': 'stop', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'text': ' unsafe\nO6'}]

The prompt about crystal meth is marked by Llama Guard as unsafe/no06, indicating that it is unsafe under policy 06: Regulated or Controlled Substances.
Policy Adjustment
Now, let's try deleting policy #6 and seeing and re-submitting the unsafe prompt:

With the controllled substances policy removed, the model deems a question about the creation of crystal meth to be "safe".  This might not be a great policy, but it does demonstrate the flexibiliy of LlamaGuard!
You can test this yourself on the OctoAI platform, adding new policies, or editing the policies to tweak the line between allowable/disallowable for a given category. Try out safe/unsafe prompts and see how flexible Llama Guard can be!",

Unstructured is both an open-source library and an API service. The library provides components for ingesting and pre-processing images and text documents, such as PDFs, HTML, Word docs, and many more.
It also provides components to very easily embed these documents. In Unstructured's jargon this component is called an EmbeddingEncoder. The OctoAIEmbedingEncoder is available, so documents parsed with Unstructured can easily be embedded with the OctoAI embeddings endpoint.
Using the OctoAIEmbeddingEncocer
The OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder class connects to the OctoAI Text&Embedding API to obtain embeddings for pieces of text.
embed_documents will receive a list of Elements, and return an updated list which includes the embeddings attribute for each Element.
embed_query will receive a query as a string, and return a list of floats which is the embedding vector for the given query string.
num_of_dimensions is a metadata property that denotes the number of dimensions in any embedding vector obtained via this class.
is_unit_vector is a metadata property that denotes if embedding vectors obtained via this class are unit vectors.
The following code block shows an example of how to use OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder.
You will see the updated elements list (with the embeddings attribute included for each element),
the embedding vector for the query string, and some metadata properties about the embedding model.
You will need to set an environment variable named OCTOAI_API_KEY to be able to run this example.

Web UI playground
You can start familiarizing yourself with our Media Gen features using the web UI, but note that we have even more features available via the API.
First, click on the top navigation bar and click Media Tools. Here you will see that Image Generation, Image Animation are available to use via Demo and API. Curently, for other image utilities such as background removal, photo merge, inpainting, outpainting and upscaling, only APIs are available.

When you navigate to the Image Gen Demo, you will see this page where you can play with the different settings and click the Generate button to start generating images!

Default settings for SDXL run at about 3.1 seconds of latency.
You can customize images by selecting different checkpoints, LoRAs, and Textual Inversions. This increases E2E latency slightly, but is still blazing fast thanks to OctoAI's proprietary Asset Orchestrator technology, which enables fast loading and smart caching of assets.

If you want to see a list of all public assets in the OctoAI library as well as your own private assets, you can navigate to the Asset Library page via the top nav bar.


Additionally, when you navigate to the Image Animation Demo, you will see this page where you can play with the different settings and click the Generate button to start generating videos!

Default settings for SVD1.1 run at about 30 seconds of latency.
You can leverage advanced video settings such as motion scale, cfg scale, frames per secs, steps and tailor the output of your 3 secs image animation.

    "description": "You can tweak your images using various customizations available within OctoAI Media Gen solution including checkpoints, LoRAs, textual inversions and ControlNets

With OctoAI Media Gen solution, you can effortlessly integrate Stable Diffusion’s customizable image generation features into your application. While standard pre-trained image generation assets from repositories like HuggingFace may suffice for simple tasks, customization becomes crucial for commercial uses. Customization allows precise control over generating specific subjects and environments, which is essential for most commercial needs. Stable Diffusion, offered by OctoAI, provides both basic and advanced customization options. These include adjusting prompt weights, applying style presets, and employing advanced techniques like LoRAs, checkpoints, textual inversions, and ControlNets. Additionally, with OctoAI, you can create your own LoRA asset using custom image datasets and leverage it to meet your business requirements.

    "description": "Custom checkpoints are fine-tuned versions of the original model and allow users to refine customizations while creating images or videos.

Custom Stable Diffusion checkpoints are fine-tuned versions of the original model, trained to capture particular styles, subjects, or objects. They are designed to provide users with more control and customization options when generating images. These checkpoints can be tailored to produce images in various styles, such as realistic photography, artwork, or even specific themes like landscapes or portraits.
While checkpoints represent a significant investment in terms of storage and computational resources, they excel in maintaining the desired customizations consistently. OctoAI's Asset Library boasts a rich collection of pre-loaded custom checkpoints, offering a diverse array of styles to enhance your images. Additionally, users have the flexibility to import bespoke checkpoints from external sources, integrating them seamlessly into OctoAI's Asset Library as personalized assets.

    The image results with different checkpoints, even using the same prompt, can be significantly different. Using the simple prompt `A photo of an Australian cattle dog running through a park`, you can see see the results from the SDXL base model (left) and samaritan model (right). The samaritan model represents a 3D-cartoon image style.

    "description": "LoRAs for image or video AI models are custom weights applied to a base checkpoint. LoRAs are a way to make highly customized AI images or videos.

LoRAs are additional custom weights applied to a base checkpoint. Similar to checkpoints, LoRAs can represent a specific style or custom subject, but they are much smaller in size and more economical to use. You can include multiple LoRAs in a single image generation, and provide a weight for each LoRA. A greater weight value will have more influence on the generated image. Similar to checkpoints, users have the flexibility to import LoRAs from external sources, and integrate them seamlessly into OctoAI's Asset Library as personalized assets.

    Below is an example of using a LoRA along with a simple prompt `Commercial photography,snowy,luxury perfume bottle,angelic silver light, studio light, high resolution photography, fine details`. You can see the results from the SDXL base model (top left) and subsequent results with add-detail LoRA - varying weights (top right and bottom left). Add-details LoRA adds intricate details to the output image. The image generated on the botton right is a result of two LoRAs, add-details (weight:0.3) and more-art (weight:1.0). More-art LoRA adds artistic details to the output image. You can clearly see the impact of more-art LoRA over add-detail LoRA in the resulting image.

Similar to checkpoints, LoRAs can represent a specific style or custom subject, but they are much smaller in size and more economical to use. You can include multiple LoRAs in a single image generation, and provide a weight for each LoRA. A greater weight value will have more influence on the generated image. Similar to checkpoints, users have the flexibility to import LoRAs from external sources, and integrate them seamlessly into OctoAI's Asset Library as personalized assets.
Below is an example of using a LoRA along with a simple prompt Commercial photography,snowy,luxury perfume bottle,angelic silver light, studio light, high resolution photography, fine details. You can see the results from the SDXL base model (top left) and subsequent results with add-detail LoRA - varying weights (top right and bottom left). Add-details LoRA adds intricate details to the output image. The image generated on the botton right is a result of two LoRAs, add-details (weight:0.3) and more-art (weight:1.0). More-art LoRA adds artistic details to the output image. You can clearly see the impact of more-art LoRA over add-detail LoRA in the resulting image.

    "description": "Customize your images on OctoAI using Textual inversions, which are embeddings that represent custom subjects.

Textual inversions are embeddings that represent custom subjects.They can also represent negative embeddings, which are trained on undesirable content like bad quality hands or lighting. You can use these in your _negative_ prompt to improve your images, such as avoiding bad quality hands. These are the smallest and cheapest assets we currently support.
The name of the textual inversion acts as a specific trigger word, which must be included in the prompt. Similar to prompt weighting, you can increase the weight of textual inversion using the format `(textual-inversion:weight)`.

    Below is an example of using a NegativeXL textual inversion (trigger word: negativeXL_D).

    Prompt:  `Commercial photography,snowy,luxury perfume bottle,angelic silver light, studio light, high resolution photography, fine details`

    Negative prompt: `Blurry photo, distortion, low-res, poor quality, (flowers on bottle negativeXL_D:0.9), (snowflake on bottle negativeXL_D:0.9), (colored liquid in bottle negativeXL_D:1.0)`

    You can see the results from the SDXL base model (left) generating an image with snowflake or flower shaped designs on the bottle and subsequent results with textual inversion (right) which ensures that the negative prompt is followed and no flower, snowflake design appears on the bottle in the output image.

You can emphasize, or de-emphasize, specific words or phrases of the image generation prompt using weighting. To use prompt weighting, format your prompt using parentheses: `prompt = "A cat with (long whiskers)"`

    This emphasizes the phrase “long whiskers” with a weight of `1.1`. Adding additional parentheses such as `"\(\(\(long whiskers)))"` performs additional multiples of `1.1`, so for 3 sets of parentheses, the weight would be `1.33`. More specific weights can also be specified in the form: `prompt = "A cat with (long whiskers: 0.8)"`

    This will weigh all words in the parentheses by a factor of `0.8`. Notably, weights do not have to be greater than one. Using a weight of less than 1 will de-emphasize the contained words.

     Using weights in negative prompts can also be helpful. For example, you can avoid distorted hands: `negative_prompt = "(distorted hands: 1.5)"`",

    "description": "OctoAI's asset library is pre-populated with the most popular available ControlNets which allow added image input to influence and customize the image generation.

While traditional image generation models can produce stunning visuals, they often lack guidance, and therefore the ability to generate images subject to user-desired image composition. ControlNet changes the game by allowing an additional image input that can be used for conditioning (influencing) the final image generation. This could be anything from simple scribbles to detailed depth maps or edge maps. By conditioning on these input images, ControlNet directs the Stable Diffusion model to generate images that align closely with the user's intent.

**OctoAI's Asset Library** comes pre-populated with the followinglist of public controlnets.

```
octoai:canny_sdxl
octoai:depth_sdxl
octoai:openpose_sdxl
octoai:canny_sd15
octoai:depth_sd15
octoai:inpaint_sd15
octoai:ip2p_sd15
octoai:lineart_sd15
octoai:openpose_sd15
octoai:scribble_sd15
octoai:tile_sd15
```

Other than using the default controlnet checkpoints, you can also upload private ControlNet checkpoints into the OctoAI Asset Library and then use those checkpoints at generation time via the parameter `controlnet` in the API. For custom controlnet checkpoints, make sure to provide your own ControlNet mask in the `controlnet_image` parameter.

Below is an example of using a **Canny ControlNet** along with ControlNet image (left) and a simple prompt `A photo of woman wearing a (rose  pink dress:1)`. Canny ControlNet is designed to detect a wide range of edges in images. Given a raw image or sketch, Canny can extract the image's contours and edges, and use them for image generation. You can see the image (right) generated from SDXL with Canny ControlNet applied.

Below is an example of using a **OpenPose ControlNet** along with ControlNet image (left) and a prompt `An photo of a white man on a japanese tatami mat `. OpenPose ControlNet is a fast human keypoint detection model that can extract human poses like positions of hands, legs, and head. See the example below. You can see the image (right) generated from SDXL with OpenPose ControlNet applied.

    "content": "While traditional image generation models can produce stunning visuals, they often lack guidance, and therefore the ability to generate images subject to user-desired image composition. ControlNet changes the game by allowing an additional image input that can be used for conditioning (influencing) the final image generation. This could be anything from simple scribbles to detailed depth maps or edge maps. By conditioning on these input images, ControlNet directs the Stable Diffusion model to generate images that align closely with the user's intent.
OctoAI's Asset Library comes pre-populated with the followinglist of public controlnets.
octoai:canny_sdxl
octoai:depth_sdxl
octoai:openpose_sdxl
octoai:canny_sd15
octoai:depth_sd15
octoai:inpaint_sd15
octoai:ip2p_sd15
octoai:lineart_sd15
octoai:openpose_sd15
octoai:scribble_sd15
octoai:tile_sd15

Other than using the default controlnet checkpoints, you can also upload private ControlNet checkpoints into the OctoAI Asset Library and then use those checkpoints at generation time via the parameter controlnet in the API. For custom controlnet checkpoints, make sure to provide your own ControlNet mask in the controlnet_image parameter.
Below is an example of using a Canny ControlNet along with ControlNet image (left) and a simple prompt A photo of woman wearing a (rose  pink dress:1). Canny ControlNet is designed to detect a wide range of edges in images. Given a raw image or sketch, Canny can extract the image's contours and edges, and use them for image generation. You can see the image (right) generated from SDXL with Canny ControlNet applied.

    "description": "A new technology called SDXL Lighting enables high-quality image generations in less than 1 second

SDXL Lighting enable you to achieve high-quality output from SDXL with only 4-8 steps and less than 1 second of latency. This stands in stark contrast to generating images using SDXL model, which typically demands 30-40 steps to produce a good quality image in 3-3.5 seconds, and even more when incorporating custom assets like LoRAs. More importantly, SDXL Lighting is completely compatible with existing image customization techniques available on OctoAI such as SDXL LoRAs. Customers using this can achieve both fast inference speed and product differentiation via customization.

You can use SDXL Lighting via OctoAI's [Image Gen API](../rest-apis/image-gen-api)

The following guidelines must be adhered to ensure high quality of output:

- Opt for 4-8 steps, with 8 steps being the recommended choice.
- Maintain a low CFG Scale, ideally ranging from 1.4 to 4.0, with 3.0 as the optimal value.
- Utilize any sampler, textual inversion, or style preset.
- Note that additional LoRAs and VAEs will result in increased inference time.

    "description": "SSD-1B, a distilled version of SDXL generates images 50% faster than SDXL.

The primary advantage of utilizing Stable Diffusion SSD lies in its remarkable efficiency, boasting a 50% faster speed compared to SDXL, owing to its more compact design. Moreover, OctoAI has implemented its exclusive compiler and cloud system optimizations, culminating in an unparalleled end-to-end average generation speed of 1.4 seconds — establishing it as the swiftest iteration of SSD-1B available in the market.

However, it's essential to acknowledge certain limitations inherent to the SSD-1B model. Due to its distillation into a smaller form, the resultant output images deviate from those produced by SDXL. In essence, even with identical seed and API parameters, replicating the same output images as SDXL is no longer feasible. Furthermore, the community surrounding this novel model remains comparatively modest in size compared to that of SDXL. Consequently, the availability of finely-tuned assets such as checkpoints and LoRAs for tailoring styles, objects, and facial features is notably limited.

    "content": "The primary advantage of utilizing Stable Diffusion SSD lies in its remarkable efficiency, boasting a 50% faster speed compared to SDXL, owing to its more compact design. Moreover, OctoAI has implemented its exclusive compiler and cloud system optimizations, culminating in an unparalleled end-to-end average generation speed of 1.4 seconds — establishing it as the swiftest iteration of SSD-1B available in the market.
However, it's essential to acknowledge certain limitations inherent to the SSD-1B model. Due to its distillation into a smaller form, the resultant output images deviate from those produced by SDXL. In essence, even with identical seed and API parameters, replicating the same output images as SDXL is no longer feasible. Furthermore, the community surrounding this novel model remains comparatively modest in size compared to that of SDXL. Consequently, the availability of finely-tuned assets such as checkpoints and LoRAs for tailoring styles, objects, and facial features is notably limited.

Requirements

First, create an OctoAI API token.
Then, complete Python SDK Installation & Setup..

If you use the OCTOAI_TOKEN envvar for your token, you can instantiate the image_gen client with client = OctoAI().image_gen



Simple Text to Image Generation Example
from octoai.util import to_file
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # If OCTOAI_TOKEN is not set as an envvar, you can also pass a token to the client with:
    # ImageGenerator(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
    client = OctoAI()
    # images is a list of Images from octoai.types
    image_resp = client.image_gen.generate_sdxl(
        prompt="photorealistic, poodle, intricately detailed"
    )
    images = image_resp.images

    # images can be filtered for safety, so since we only generated 1 image by default, this verifies
    # we actually have an image to show.
    if not images[0].removed_for_safety:
        to_file(images[0], "output.jpg")

After running this simple prompt, you should hopefully have an output somewhat similar to the image below:

A good start and in our next example, we'll use more features to help guide our outputs.
Text to Image Generation Example
One of the simplest ways to customize your outputs is a style preset, negative_prompt, loras, and model selection.
from octoai.util import to_file
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = OctoAI()

    prompt = "photorealistic, colorful, poodle, intricately detailed"
    file_name = "pretty_poodle_cinematic.jpeg"

    images_resp = client.image_gen.generate_sdxl(
        prompt=prompt,
        negative_prompt="horror, scary, low-quality, extra limbs, cartoon",
        checkpoint="crystal-clear",
        style_preset="cinematic",
        loras={"add-detail": 1.0},
        steps=50,
    )
    images = images_resp.images
    # It can also be helpful to run another generate method with
    # num_images = image_resp.removed_for_safety to get your desired total images
    if not images[0].removed_for_safety:
        to_file(images[0], file_name)



Much more realistic! Now that we have our cinematic poodle, let's go ahead and use this image as part of an image-to-image workflow.
Image to Image Generation Example
Image to Image Generation lets you use a base image, in our case the above pretty_poodle.jpeg to shape the feel of your outputs image. In our case, we'd expect some focal point in the center, and a blurred, bright background, but otherwise our output can look anywhere from completely different or quite similar depending on our prompt. In this case, let's go for a complete different style of outputs and stray from the usual theme of poodles to a corgi in the rain.
from octoai.util import to_file, from_file
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = OctoAI()

    init = from_file("pretty_poodle_cinematic.jpeg")
    images_resp = client.image_gen.generate_sdxl(
        prompt="corgi in the rain",
        init_image=init,  # Only used for image-to-image
        strength=0.8,  # Only used for image-to-image
        style_preset="anime"
    )
    images = images_resp.images

    to_file(images[0], "rain_corgi.jpeg")

In the web UI, navigate to the Tuning & Datasets page from the Media Gen Solution menu to get started - any previously tuned models will also be listed here. Click on “New Tune” to continue.
Configure settings
Specify the name of your fine-tune, the trigger word of the subject you're fine-tuning, and the base checkpoint. The base checkpoint can be the default Stable Diffusion v1.5 checkpoint, default Stable Diffusion XL checkpoint, or any custom checkpoint.
The trigger word can be used in your inference requests to customize the images with your subject. We generally recommend using a unique trigger word, such as "sks1", that's unlikely to be associated with a different subject in Stable Diffusion. Alternatively, you can use an existing concept as the trigger word value - such as "in the style of a cartoon drawing" - to update Stable Diffusion's understanding of that concept.
Then, specify the number of steps to train. A range of 400 to 1,200 steps works well in most cases, and a good guideline is about 75 to 100 steps per training image. The model can underfit if the numer of training steps is too low, resulting in poor quality. If it's too high, the model can overfit and struggle to represent details that aren't represented in the training images.

Upload images & tune
Next, upload your training images and start tuning. We recommend using varied images, including different backgrounds, lightings, and distances. Finding a balance between variation and consistency can help improve image generation quality. All uploaded images used for fine-tuning must comply with our terms of service.
Optionally, you can provide captions for each image that describe the custom subject. This can help improve fine-tuning and the quality of generated images. Make sure to include your trigger word in the caption.
When you're ready, click "Start Tuning", and the fine-tune job will progress from pending to running before completing.
Generating images
When complete, the fine-tuned asset is stored in your Asset Library and available for image generation. You can launch the Text to Image or Image to Image tool to start generating images with your custom asset.

API Guide
Complete fine-tuning API parameters are organized in our API Reference documentation.
Upload images
First, upload your training images using the AssetLibrary Python Client or CLI.
Python client
You can easily upload individual image files, or a folder with multiple files. Here's an example uploading the image1.jpeg file with the name image1 from the file path finetuning_images:
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.asset_library import Data_File

client = OctoAI()

asset = client.asset_library.create_from_file(
    file="finetuning_images/image1.jpeg",
    data=Data_File(file_format="jpeg"),
    name="image1",
    description="Fine-tuning image",
)

print(asset)
print(client.asset_library.list(name="image1"))

client.asset_library.list()

You'll receive a response with the asset ID, name, and status:
id: asset_01hf3a2qw7ek6vshbhd9c9yywd, name: image1, status: Status.UPLOADED

Here's an example uploading a folder of images. This code snippet gets the files in the folder named finetuning_images, then splits on the . to get the files_format extension (jpg, jpeg, or png). Then the file names are used to set the asset names:
import os
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.asset_library import Data_File

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # OCTOAI_TOKEN set as an environment variable so do not need to pass a token.
    client = OctoAI()

    dir_path = "./finetuning_images/"  # Set your dir_path here to your file assets.
    files = []
    # Get a list of files in the folder
    for file_path in os.listdir(dir_path):
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir_path, file_path)):
            files.append(file_path)
    for file in files:
        # Use the file names to get file_format and the asset_name.
        split_file_name = file.split(".")
        asset_name = split_file_name[0]
        file_format = split_file_name[1]
        file_data = Data_File(
            file_format=file_format,
        )
        asset = client.asset_library.create_from_file(
            file=dir_path + file,
            data=file_data,
            name=asset_name,
        )

        print(asset)

The final print(asset) will return a response with each asset ID, name, and status:
CLI
Alternatively, you can upload images using the OctoAI CLI. Here's the CLI command using the same image1.jpeg example:
octoai asset create \
  --upload-from-file finetuning_images/image1.jpeg \
  --name image1 \
  --type file

Configure settings & tune
Next, create your fine-tune. In the examples in this section, we're fine-tuning Stable Diffusion XL with images of a bulldog. We specify the base checkpoint, trigger word, training steps, and fine-tune name. Also included are the individual training images and corresponding captions. We recommend including captions, describing the context of the subject, to improve fine-tuning quality. Be sure to include your trigger word within the caption.
Python Client
from octoai.fine_tuning import Details_LoraTune, LoraTuneCheckpoint, LoraTuneFile
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
  client = OctoAI()

  # create a fine tuning job
  tune = client.fine_tuning.create(
    name="sks1-bulldog-01",
    details=Details_LoraTune(
        files=[
            LoraTuneFile(file_id="asset_01hekxwwg1fzjv48sfy5s2xmnj", caption="sks1 bulldog playing at the beach"),
            LoraTuneFile(file_id="asset_01hekxwqgrev5t3ser2w2qf8bm", caption="sks1 bulldog playing with a bone"),
            LoraTuneFile(file_id="asset_01hekxwj3bekpvr52kne3c6ca7", caption="sks1 bulldog looking up"),
            LoraTuneFile(file_id="asset_01hekxwdc8eqrrahjm3ekze356", caption="sks1 bulldog resting in the grass"),
            LoraTuneFile(file_id="asset_01hekxw80kfdmrdh7ny3vyvf0h", caption="sks1 bulldog running at the park"),
        ],
        base_checkpoint=LoraTuneCheckpoint(
            checkpoint_id="asset_01hdpjv7bxe1n99eazrv23ca1k",
            engine="image/stable-diffusion-xl-v1-0",
        ),
        trigger_words=["sks1"],
        steps=800,
    )
  )
  print(f"Tune {tune.name} status: {tune.status}")

  # check the status of a fine tuning job
  tune = client.fine_tuning.get(tune.id)
  print(f"Tune {tune.name} status: {tune.status}")

  # when the job finishes, check the asset ids of the resulted loras
  # (the tune will take some time to complete)
  if tune.status == "succeded":
    print(f"Generated LoRAs: {tune.output_lora_ids}")

General fine-tuning tips
Image captions
Image captions can improve quality by providing additional context and details to the trained model. Whenever possible, we suggest using image captions - and be sure to include your trigger word in each caption.
You can also include the subject class - such as person, animal, or object - to improve quality. As an example, you could fine-tune images of a specific bulldog with an example caption sks1 bulldog playing at the beach where sks1 is the trigger word and bulldog is the subject class.
Image variation
We recommend some amount of variation in your images. If every image is close-up, the fine-tuned model may be limited to representing that distance. It's also helpful to have some level of consistency among the images to ensure the model learns the intended subject. Finding the right balance between consistency and variation can require a few iterations, and we encourage you to experiment!
Managing fine-tunes and assets
You can separately manage a fine-tune job, and the corresponding LoRA created by a fine-tune. Deleting a fine-tune job won't automatically delete the training images nor LoRA created during fine-tuning, and vice versa. Additionally, fine-tune names must be unique. You may encounter an error if you try to create a fine-tune with a duplicate name.
Fine-tuning duration
Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 usually takes about 3-7 minutes, and Stable Diffusion XL takes about 10-20 minutes. Increasing the number of training steps will extend the fine-tuning duration.",

Python client
You can easily upload individual image files, or a folder with multiple files. Here's an example uploading the image1.jpeg file with the name image1 from the file path finetuning_images:
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.asset_library import Data_File

client = OctoAI()

asset = client.asset_library.create_from_file(
    file="finetuning_images/image1.jpeg",
    data=Data_File(file_format="jpeg"),
    name="image1",
    description="Fine-tuning image",
)

print(asset)
print(client.asset_library.list(name="image1"))

client.asset_library.list()

You'll receive a response with the asset ID, name, and status:
id: asset_01hf3a2qw7ek6vshbhd9c9yywd, name: image1, status: Status.UPLOADED

Here's an example uploading a folder of images. This code snippet gets the files in the folder named finetuning_images, then splits on the . to get the files_format extension (jpg, jpeg, or png). Then the file names are used to set the asset names:
import os
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.asset_library import Data_File

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # OCTOAI_TOKEN set as an environment variable so do not need to pass a token.
    client = OctoAI()

    dir_path = "./finetuning_images/"  # Set your dir_path here to your file assets.
    files = []
    # Get a list of files in the folder
    for file_path in os.listdir(dir_path):
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir_path, file_path)):
            files.append(file_path)
    for file in files:
        # Use the file names to get file_format and the asset_name.
        split_file_name = file.split(".")
        asset_name = split_file_name[0]
        file_format = split_file_name[1]
        file_data = Data_File(
            file_format=file_format,
        )
        asset = client.asset_library.create_from_file(
            file=dir_path + file,
            data=file_data,
            name=asset_name,
        )

        print(asset)

The final print(asset) will return a response with each asset ID, name, and status:
CLI
Alternatively, you can upload images using the OctoAI CLI. Here's the CLI command using the same image1.jpeg example:
octoai asset create \
  --upload-from-file finetuning_images/image1.jpeg \
  --name image1 \
  --type file

Requirements

Please create an OctoAI API token if you don't have one already.
Please also verify you've completed TypeScript SDK Installation & Setup.
If you use the OCTOAI_TOKEN environment variable for your token, you can instantiate the client with const octoai = new OctoAIClient() or pass the token as a parameter to the constructor like const octoai = new OctoAIClient({ apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN }).
An account and API token is required for all the following steps.

High-level steps to creating a fine-tuned LoRA
In order to run a LoRA fine-tuning job, you need to complete a few steps:

Create image file assets using the Asset Library, then wait for those assets' status to be ready
Either create a checkpoint asset you would like to use or get one from OctoAI's public checkpoints.
Create a tune job, then wait for the status to be succeeded.
Run an inference with the new LoRA.

Directions with all the code put together are included at the bottom of the document, but at each step we will cover additional information.
1) Creating image file assets
Asset Library in the TypeScript SDK covers more specifics about the methods, so this example will be focused on a code snippet for uploading multiple files from a folder at once.
In this example, we will use multiple photos of a toy poodle named Mitchi.
import fs from "node:fs";
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
});

const fileNames = fs.readdirSync("./images");

console.log("Uploading files...");

const assets = await Promise.all(
    fileNames.map((fileName) => {
        const imageName = fileName.split(".")[0];

        return octoai.assetLibrary.upload(`./images/${fileName}`, {
            name: imageName,
            description: imageName,
            assetType: "file",
            data: {
                assetType: "file",
                fileFormat: "jpg",
            },
        });
    })
);

console.log("Waiting for assets to be ready...");

for (const { asset } of assets) {
    await octoai.assetLibrary.waitForReady(asset.id);
    console.log(`Asset "${asset.name}" is ready`);
}

After this completes, all assets will hopefully be in the ready state, or you should time out. Mitchi is now on OctoAI!

2) Get a checkpoint asset to use for tuning our LoRA
Next, you'll need a checkpoint to use to tune your asset. In this example, we will just use the default checkpoint using Stable Diffusion 1.5, but you can also use other public OctoAI checkpoints or create your own using the Asset Library.
const checkpoint = await octoai.assetLibrary.get("octoai:default-sd15");

3) Creating a tune
We can create a tune by passing in the id of the checkpoint we'd like to use and the ids of the file assets that we created in Step 1. If you want more accurate results, you can add captions to each image to give more thorough descriptions. If no custom captions are provided, the trigger word will be used as a default.
console.log("Creating tune...");

let tune = await octoai.fineTuning.create({
    name: "mitchi",
    description: "mitchi",
    details: {
        tuneType: "lora_tune",
        baseCheckpoint: {
            checkpointId: checkpoint.asset.id,
        },
        // You can add a `caption` to each file for more accurate results
        files: assets.map(({ asset }) => ({ fileId: asset.id })),
        steps: 10,
        triggerWords: ["sksmitchi"],
    },
});

console.log("Waiting for tune to be ready...");

while (tune.status !== "failed" && tune.status !== "succeeded") {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    tune = await octoai.fineTuning.get(tune.id);
}

4) Run an inference with the tuned LoRA
Next, you can run an inference with the tuned LoRA
console.log("Generating image...");

const { images } = await octoai.imageGen.generateSdxl({
    prompt: "A photo of an sksmitchi as a puppy",
    negativePrompt: "Blurry photo, distortion, low-res, poor quality, extra limbs, extra tails",
    loras: {
        mitchi: 0.8,
    },
    numImages: 1,
});

images.forEach((image, index) => {
    if (image.imageB64) {
        const buffer = Buffer.from(image.imageB64, "base64");
        fs.writeFileSync(`result${index}.jpg`, buffer);
    }
});

The end result will be a saved poodle to your local folder.

- Public assets in the OctoAI Asset Library
- Upload your custom asset to the OctoAI Asset Library (private by default, and optionally public)
- Or use OctoAI fine-tuning to create new assets - see [Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/create)

This tutorial explains how to upload your own private assets to the Asset Library.

1. First download the OctoAI CLI by following the instructions in [CLI Installation.](/docs/cli/cli-and-sdk-installation) Check that it is properly installed by running the following in your terminal:

```bash bash
$ octoai asset --help
Manage OctoAI assets

Usage:
  octoai asset [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create asset
  delete      Delete an asset
  get         Get asset
  list        List assets

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for asset

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set log level: fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")

Use "octoai asset [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

1. Run `octoai login` to cache your token and authenticate to your account.
2. We can now use the `octoai asset create` subcommand to upload assets (you can run `octoai asset create --help` to learn more on the options).
   1. `--engine` denotes whether this is an asset for SDXL or SD1.5
   2. `--upload-from-file` flag denotes the path of the file on your local machine that you’re trying to upload.
   3. `--upload-from-url` flag is an alternative to `upload-from-file` allowing you to upload an asset from a public URL; OctoAI will fetch and upload the file.
   4. `—type` can be lora, checkpoint, or textual_inversion (VAEs coming soon)
   5. `--format` denotes the format of your asset, which can be safetensors or pt.
   6. `--datatype` can be fp16, fp32, int4, or int8\. For image gen, it should almost always be fp16, but for LLMs and other modalities your asset may have other datatypes.
   7. `--name` is a name for your asset. You can only use each asset name once.
   8. `--transfer-api` defaults to sts which is the fastest way to upload a large asset.
   9. If you are uploading a textual inversion, make sure to use the `-w` flag to denote the default trigger word for the asset. That trigger word can later be used at generation time to activate the inversion. For LoRAs, trigger words are optional.

As an example, you could use this command to upload a checkpoint from your local machine:

```
octoai asset create \
  --upload-from-file LCM_Dreamshaper_v7.safetensors \
  --name Dreamshaper_v7 \
  --engine image/stable-diffusion-v1-5 \
  --format safetensors \
  --data-type fp16 \
  --type checkpoint \
  --description "Dreamshaper v7"
```

You can alternatively upload the file via public URL using `upload-from-url`:

```
octoai asset create \
  --upload-from-url https://huggingface.co/SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7/resolve/main/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7_4k.safetensors?download=true \
  --name Dreamshaper_v7 \

  --format safetensors \
  --data-type fp16 \
  --type checkpoint \

Requirements

First, create an OctoAI API token.
Then, complete Python SDK Installation & Setup..

If you use the OCTOAI_TOKEN envvar for your token, you can instantiate the asset_orch client with asset_library = AssetLibrary()



Overview of AssetLibrary API
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # If you have an OCTOAI_TOKEN set as an environment variable, you do not need to pass a token.
  # If one is not set, you can use:
  # asset_library = AssetLibrary(token="your OctoAI API Token goes here")
  client = OctoAI()
  asset_library = client.asset_library
  # You can get a list of the public OctoAI assets
  print(asset_library.list(is_public=True, owner="octoai"))
  # You can get a specific asset, either one you created or in this example an OctoAI asset
  asset = asset_library.get("octoai:product_photography_v1")
  # And also create, delete, or use those assets to generate images as in the below example.
  asset_library.delete("asset_id_goes_here")


Creating a LoRA and Generating an Image
You will need a safetensors file in order to use this example, and in our case one is named origami-paper.safetensors. I'll be using a lora trained on origami that I can use with the words "origami" and "paper".
In this example, we will be adding a LoRA then using it to generate an image. You can also add checkpoints, vae, and textual inversions.
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.asset_library import Data_Lora
from octoai.util import to_file

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # OCTOAI_TOKEN set as an environment variable so do not need to pass a token.
    client = OctoAI()
    asset_library = client.asset_library
    image_gen = client.image_gen

    asset_name = "origami-paper-test"
    # There is also TextualInversionData, VAEData, and CheckpointData.
    lora_data = Data_Lora(
        data_type="fp16",
        engine="image/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
        file_format="safetensors",
    )

    asset = asset_library.create_from_file(
        file="origami-paper.safetensors",
        data=lora_data,
        name=asset_name,
        description="origami-paper stable diffusion 1.5",
    )

    image_gen_resp = image_gen.generate_sd(
        prompt="rainbow origami tailong dragon",
        num_images=4,
        loras={"asset": 0.8}
    )

    # Some images can be removed for safety.
    # Please see the ImageGenerator client docs for more information.
    for i, image in enumerate(image_gen_resp.images):
        to_file(image, f"result{i}.jpg")

    # You can clean up your asset with the following:
    asset_library.delete(asset.id)


rainbow-origami-tailong-dragon.png
Creating File Assets from a Folder of Images
Let's say you have a folder of images assets you would like to upload for using the FineTuning service. You can do so using the below code snippet to get all the files in your folder named images, and then splitting on the . to get your file_format extension (jpg, jpeg, or png), and use the file name as the asset name.
In this example, there is a directory named images that contains files with a _, -, and alphanumeric file names, jpg, jpeg, or png suffixes. In this example, the folder contains the following:
./assets/images/
	result0.jpg
	result1.jpg
	result2.jpg
	result3.jpg
	save_the_other_paper_poodle.png
	save_the_paper_poodle.png

import os
from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.asset_library import Data_File

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # OCTOAI_TOKEN set as an environment variable so do not need to pass a token.
    client = OctoAI()

    dir_path = "./assets/images/"  # Set your dir_path here to your file assets.
    files = []
    # Get a list of files in the folder
    for file_path in os.listdir(dir_path):
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir_path, file_path)):
            files.append(file_path)
    for file in files:
        # Use the file names to get file_format and the asset_name.
        split_file_name = file.split(".")
        asset_name = split_file_name[0]
        file_format = split_file_name[1]
        file_data = Data_File(
            file_format=file_format,
        )
        asset = client.asset_library.create_from_file(
            file=dir_path + file,
            data=file_data,
            name=asset_name,
        )

You can then use octoai.asset_library.list() to see the assets have been created and uploaded and a result that looks something like:
[
id: asset_01234567891011121314151617, name: save_the_paper_poodle, status: ready,
id: asset_01234567891011121314151618, name: save_the_other_paper_poodle, status: ready,
id: asset_01234567891011121314151619, name: result2, status: ready,
id: asset_01234567891011121314151620, name: result3, status: ready,
id: asset_01234567891011121314151621, name: result1, status: ready,
id: asset_01234567891011121314151622, name: result0, status: ready,
id: asset_01234567891011121314151600, name: origami-paper-test, status: uploaded]

In this example, an already existing lora created in the previous example also exists. The lora has uploaded however will likely need a few more seconds before being ready for use.",

Requirements

First, create an OctoAI API token.
Then, complete TypeScript SDK Installation & Setup..

If you use the OCTOAI_TOKEN environment variable for your token, you can instantiate the client with const octoai = new OctoAIClient() or pass the token as a parameter to the constructor.



Overview of AssetLibrary API
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
    apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN
});

const assetListResponse = await octoai.assetLibrary.list();
console.log(JSON.stringify(assetListResponse.data, undefined, 2));

const assetListStableDiffusion = await octoai.assetLibrary.list({
    isPublic: true,
    owner: "octoai",
    engine: "image/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(assetListStableDiffusion, undefined, 2));


const { asset } = await octoai.assetLibrary.get("origami-paper");
console.log(JSON.stringify(asset, undefined, 2));

await octoai.assetLibrary.delete(asset.id);

Creating a LoRA
You will need a safetensors file in order to use this example, and in our case one is named origami-paper.safetensors. I'll be using a LoRA trained on origami that I can use with the words "origami" and "paper".
In this example, we will be adding a LoRA then using it to generate an image.
The id field for the created asset can be used when Getting started with our Media Gen Solution and running inferences.
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
    apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN
});

await octoai.assetLibrary.upload("origami-paper.safetensors", {
    assetType: "lora",

    "description": "Extend beyond the canvas of an existing image.

Outpainting is the process of using an image generation model like Stable Diffusion to extend beyond the canvas of an existing image. Outpainting is very similar to inpainting, but instead of generating a region within an existing image, the model generates a region outside of it. 

 <CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Init Image">

Outpainting works both with SDXL and SD1.5. 
At a high level, outpainting works like this:
* Choose an existing image you’d like to outpaint.
* Create a source image that places your original image within a larger canvas.
* Create a black and white mask image.
* Use init_image (source image), mask_image (your mask image), a text prompt and outpainting parameter as inputs to Image Gen API to generate a new image.

In the following example we will leverage the SD1.5 engine so we’ll start with a 512x512 image. 

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Init Image (512X512)">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can extend the image in any direction, but for this example we’ll extend the width from 512 → 768. Supported resolutions for SD1.5 are:

`(W, H): (768, 576), (1024, 576), (640, 512), (384, 704), (640, 768), (640, 640), (1024, 768), (1536, 1024), (768, 1024), (576, 448), (1024, 1024), (896, 896), (704, 1216), (512, 512), (448, 576), (832, 512), (512, 704), (576, 768), (1216, 704), (512, 768), (512, 832), (1024, 1536), (576, 1024), (704, 384), (768, 512)
`

Support resolutions for SDXL are: 

`(W, H): {(1536, 640), (768, 1344), (832, 1216), (1344, 768), (1152, 896), (640, 1536), (1216, 832), (896, 1152), (1024, 1024)}`

Two images are required for the next step. An init_image and mask_image are required in order to perform the outpainting to 768 pixels. Convert both images to base64.

    "description": "Automatically fix faces and hands using Adetailer

OctoAI's Adetailer API supports various detection models. Whether you're interested in identifying faces, or hands, you can choose from options such as face_yolov8n, hand_yolov8n, face_full_mediapipe, face_short_mediapipe, face_mesh_mediapipe, and eyes_mesh_mediapipe. This allows you to tailor the detailing process to your specific needs and preferences.

Adetailer effortlessly identifies faces and hands in images, automatically creating masks to fill in any missing parts. After this, it seamlessly integrates with the SDXL API, applying customized settings to achieve outstanding results. Additionally, OctoAI's  Adetailer API offers flexibility by allowing users to set the maximum number of detections. For example, if there are five people in an image but you only want to focus on two faces, you can easily do so using the max_num_detections parameter. The API prioritizes and corrects faces based on their confidence score and bounding box dimensions.

Whether you're interested in identifying faces, or hands, you can choose from options such as face_yolov8n, hand_yolov8n, face_full_mediapipe, face_short_mediapipe, face_mesh_mediapipe, and eyes_mesh_mediapipe. This allows you to tailor the detailing process to your specific needs and preferences.
Adetailer effortlessly identifies faces and hands in images, automatically creating masks to fill in any missing parts. After this, it seamlessly integrates with the SDXL API, applying customized settings to achieve outstanding results. Additionally, OctoAI's  Adetailer API offers flexibility by allowing users to set the maximum number of detections. For example, if there are five people in an image but you only want to focus on two faces, you can easily do so using the max_num_detections parameter. The API prioritizes and corrects faces based on their confidence score and bounding box dimensions.

    "description": "Seamlessly integrate a photo's subject into AI-generated output and eliminate the need to create time-consuming custom facial finetunes.

OctoAI Photo Merge feature allows you to seamlessly integrate a photo’s subject into high-quality AI-generated output. It eliminates the need to create time-consuming custom facial fine-tunes with numerous tuning images and 15-30 minutes typically associated with SDXL LoRAs. OctoAI's Photo Merge simplifies this process, requiring only 1-4 images and delivering precise results within a few seconds. Businesses can now easily apply GenAI powered imagery for needs ranging from realistic CGI characters, to personalized product recommendations, to digital avatars.

Photo Merge can be accessed through the "transfer_images" parameter within OctoAI’s Image Generation API. This parameter accepts a key-value pair consisting of a trigger word and an array of up to 4 images. It operates exclusively with SDXL models and seamlessly harmonizes with style presets, controlnets, checkpoints, and LoRAs when utilized with SDXL models, thereby amplifying its adaptability and functionality.

In the example below, we will upload 1-4 images of a human and use photo merge to transfer his face into our prompts. 

**Example Code Snippet showing the close portriat images of a human**:  

```Python Python
ENDPOINT_URL = "https://image.octoai.run/generate/sdxl"
IMAGES_PATH = "/content/images"
os.makedirs(IMAGES_PATH, exist_ok=True)

luis_path = f'{IMAGES_PATH}/luis'
luis_urls = ['https://cs.illinois.edu/_sitemanager/viewphoto.aspx?id=12289&s=206',
             'https://www.kisacoresearch.com/sites/default/files/styles/panopoly_image_square/public/speakers/luis_ceze_headshot.jpg?itok=NmVXlZb2&c=092995db2355e0f1f7ce15ff18aba155',

             ]

luis_image_names = download_from_urls(luis_urls, luis_path)

image_grid(luis_path, luis_image_names)

luis_b64_images = [encode_b64(luis_path, image) for image in luis_image_names]
```
![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45680/1709586273-luis1.png?max-w=2000&auto=compress) 

Next, we utilize the `transfer_images="triggerword": list of images parameter` within the payload of OctoAI’s SDXL Image Gen API at `https://image.octoai.run/generate/sdxl`.

**Example Code Snippet of using Photo Merge (transfer_images)**:

```Python Python
payload = {
    "prompt": "A man luis sitting in a coffee shop",
    "negative_prompt": "Blurry photo, distortion, low-res, bad quality",
    "checkpoint": "RealVisXL",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024,
    "num_images": 4,
    "sampler": "K_EULER_ANCESTRAL",
    "steps": 20,
    "cfg_scale": 7.5,
    "seed": 888,
    "transfer_images": {"luis": luis_b64_images}
}

response = query(ENDPOINT_URL, payload)

generated_images = decode_response(response)
image_grid_buffer(generated_images)
```

In the given example, we employ the trigger word ‘luis’ and link it with the dataset comprising the four images mentioned earlier. Subsequently, we structure the prompt to incorporate the trigger word.

Prompt: `A man luis sitting in a coffee shop.`

It's worth noting that in this instance, no LoRA is utilized. Additionally, we utilize a checkpoint named ‘RealVisXL’, an OctoAI asset checkpoint specifically optimized for the Photo Merge feature. However, it's important to mention that the Photo Merge feature is functional even if the base SDXL checkpoint is utilized. 

Below are the AI-generated output images after using transfer_image parameter with the newly provided prompt: 

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45680/1709586450-luis2.png?max-w=2000&auto=compress) 

Pretty accurate, isn’t it? Let’s try it with few different prompts and combine it with other style presets, LoRAs and checkpoints to confirm whether we consistently get the accurate results.

Let us use transfer_images parameter in conjunction with ‘Graffiti’ style preset. We are keeping all other parameter values similar to the payload above.

**Example Code Snippet of Photo Merge (transfer_images parameter) with Style Preset**: 

```Python Python
payload = {
    "prompt": "closeup colorfull portrait photo of a man luis",
    "negative_prompt": "(asymmetry, worst quality, low quality, illustration, 3d, 2d, painting, cartoons, sketch), open mouth",
    "checkpoint": "RealVisXL",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024,
    "num_images": 4,
    "sampler": "K_EULER_ANCESTRAL",
    "steps": 20,
    "cfg_scale": 7.5,
    "seed": 111,
    "style_preset": "Graffiti",
    "transfer_images": {"luis": luis_b64_images}
}

response = query(ENDPOINT_URL, payload)

generated_images = decode_response(response)
image_grid_buffer(generated_images)
```

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45680/1709586551-luis3.png?max-w=2000&auto=compress) 

Let’s now use transfer_images parameter with a pre-trained Style LoRA. We have already imported a pre-trained style based LoRA into OctoAI’s Asset Library. In the payload below, we are using the corresponding asset’s asset id and assigning it a weight of 1.0.

**Example Code Snippet of Photo Merge (transfer_images parameter) with pre-trained LoRAs (uploaded from external sources)**: 

```Python Python
payload = {
    "prompt": "painting, martius_storm red ominous war [:style of vincent van gogh luis and leonardo da vinci:0.4] ral-dissolve",
    "negative_prompt": "(asymmetry, worst quality, low quality, illustration, 3d, 2d, painting, cartoons, sketch), open mouth",
    "checkpoint": "RealVisXL",
    "loras": {"asset_01hnxyk06ee999h4cq1cz3r21f": 1.0},
    "width": 1024,

    "num_images": 4,
    "sampler": "DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS",
    "steps": 20,
    "cfg_scale": 7,
    "seed": 111,
    "transfer_images": {"luis": luis_b64_images}
}

response = query(ENDPOINT_URL, payload)

generated_images = decode_response(response)
image_grid_buffer(generated_images)
```
![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45680/1709587246-luis4.png?max-w=2000&auto=compress) 

Next, we'll create a custom fine-tune for a product and seamlessly integrate our AI-generated human model's image with it.
To create custom fine tunes (SDXL LoRAs), we will upload 10-12 images of our product, which in our case are different colored Lacoste polo shirts for men.

Let's now consider a use-case where we want to mix the identities of 2 or more humans. For this let's consider a new set of close up portriats of another human as shown below:

Keeping our users’ data private and secure is our priority. OctoAI requires token authentication for all API requests, along with TLS to enforce encryption in transit for all connections between the customer and OctoAI. We also use encryption at rest for any data written to disk.
SecureLink is an additional private connectivity security measure, ensuring that network traffic between an OctoAI endpoint and the customer environment is not exposed to the public internet. SecureLink is available for Enterprise customers.
Setup Steps

Configure your AWS Account ID in OctoAI
Create and configure a VPC Interface Endpoint
Configure OctoAI’s SDKs & CLI to use the SecureLink subdomain
If you intend to use Asset Library to upload your assets, configure a separate PrivateLink connection for Amazon S3 to ensure the uploads are also completed via a private connection to S3

Setup Instructions
Configure your AWS Account ID in OctoAI
First, run a simple curl command to configure your AWS account ID within OctoAI using the https://api.octoai.cloud/v1/account/securelink endpoint:
curl -X POST "https://api.octoai.cloud/v1/account/securelink" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCTOAI_TOKEN" \
    --data '{"aws_account_id": "account-ID-value"}'

This allows OctoAI to generate a VPC Service Name, which you’ll use in the next step. If you don’t receive a successful response, contact us to ensure your OctoAI account is enabled as Enterprise tier.
Create and configure a VPC Interface Endpoint
Now you’ll create the VPC Interface Endpoint in your AWS account using the VPC Service Name. Navigate to the VPC Dashboard, and click Create Endpoint from your AWS console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#Endpoints

Configure the Service Name value to com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e914445c09bbe700, then click Verify to ensure the service name is found and verified. Contact us for help if the service name is not found.

Next, choose the VPC and subnets that should be peered with the VPC service endpoint. Make sure that Enable DNS name is checked.

Then, choose the security group(s) who can send traffic to the VPC endpoint. The security group must accept inbound traffic on TCP port 443 - you can verify this within the Inbound Rules page. You can now click Create endpoint to create the VPC endpoint. The endpoint maybe take up to 10 minutes to move from Pending to Available. Once it shows Available, it’s ready for use.
Configure OctoAI’s SDKs & CLI to use SecureLink URL
Each OctoAI endpoint uses a SecureLink ingress URL, which will only work with a fully configured VPC Endpoint.
OctoAI CLI
Configure an environment variable by running:
export OCTO_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.securelink.octo.ai

TypeScript SDK
Configure the SecureLink URLs by passing in the SecureLink environment during client instantiation.
import { OctoAIClient, OctoAIEnvironment } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
  environment: OctoAIEnvironment.SecureLink,
});

Python SDK

For text generation, fine-tuning, or asset library, configure the environment parameter to use OctoAIEnvironment.SECURE_LINK in the client instantiation:

import os

from octoai.client import OctoAI
from octoai.environment import OctoAIEnvironment
token=os.environ.get("OCTOAI_TOKEN")

client = OctoAI(api_key=token, environment=OctoAIEnvironment.SECURE_LINK)

This table summarizes the SecureLink equivalent to each public API URL:
| Service                     | Public                     | SecureLink                            |

Configure private connection for Amazon S3 to upload assets through a private connection
If you are a user of Asset Library, you’ll need to configure a private connection for Amazon S3 to ensure uploads are also secured behind a private connection. Depending on your setup and your needs, you can either create a gateway endpoint, where a route table entry is added to your VPC, or create an interface endpoint, which is similar to configuring an interface endpoint for OctoAI. This guide covers setting up a gateway endpoint for S3.
To create a gateway endpoint, choose AWS services under Service category, and select com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3. Ensure the type is Gateway.

Choose the route table where the routing entry is added, then click Create Endpoint. For more information, see the S3 gateway endpoint documentation on AWS.",

OctoAI allows you to create endpoints from custom containers. We support all containers with an HTTP server written in any language, as long as your container comes with a declarative configuration of which port is exposed for inferences and is built for a GPU.

- Our coverage includes and is not limited to containers built using Fast API, cog, s2i, Nvidia Triton Inference Server, and Sagemaker/AzureML/Vertex AI based ML containers.
- We allow you to pull containers from any private registry, except registries running in a fully private network (e.g. AWS ECR, Gitlab registries in private environments). This means you can pull containers from Docker Hub, Quay, Gitlab, GitHub, etc. that are not in private networks.

If you don't already have a container in hand, [see our guide to building a custom endpoint with our CLI.](../create-custom-endpoint-using-the-cli)

In this example, we will create a production-grade endpoint for a Flan T5 container pre-built [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessahlyan/flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic) for a Question Answering application.

In the web UI, navigate to the Custom Endpoints page. Click on “New Endpoint,” then specify the following fields:
![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45680/1711726378-new-endpoint.png?max-w=2000&auto=compress)

- **Endpoint Name:** This name for your endpoint will be part of the endpoint URL you end up integrating into your application-- that URL will be `https://<endpoint-name>-<account-id>.octoai.run/<inference-route>`
- **Container Image:** The reference to your container needs to be in "\[registry/\]organization/repository\[:tag\]" format. In our example, the container image is `vanessahlyan/flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic:latest`, hosted [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessahlyan/flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic) on Docker Hub.
- **Container Port:** The port of the container at which inferences are run is 8000 in our Flan T5 example, as defined [here](https://github.com/octoml/octocloud-templates/blob/main/flan-t5-small/Dockerfile#L3). **Make sure to change the default value from 8080 to 8000 in the case of this example!**
- **Registry Credential:** Registry Credential defaults to Public, which indicates that your container is available for anyone on the internet to pull. If your container is instead stored in a private registry, follow the guide in [Pulling containers from a private registry](/docs/compute-service/create-endpoint-from-existing-container/pulling-containers-from-a-private-registry) to store your registry credentials so that we can pull the private container.
- **Health Check Path:** See [Health Check Path in custom containers](../health-check-path-in-custom-containers)
- **Enable Public Access**: By default, your endpoints are private and require an access token, but you can change this setting such that anyone who knows your endpoint URL can use it.
- **Active**: Whether to spin down all replicas and disable inferences to it.
- **Specify Secrets:** Provide secrets to mount onto the container, such as database secrets that you want to reuse across endpoints. Follow the guide in [Setting up account-wide secrets for your custom endpoints](setting-account-wide-secrets-for-custom-endpoints) to set these up.
- **Environment Variables**: Just like secrets, these variables will be mounted onto the container at runtime. If you have a variable with key foo whose value is bar, you will get a variable foo whose value is bar mounted to the container.
- **Select hardware:** We offer three tiers of hardware-- see [Hardware, Pricing, and Billing](/docs/getting-started/pricing-and-billing) for more information. Your choice of hardware determines the pricing that you will pay for your endpoint.
- **Minimum Replicas:** The default minimum number of replicas is 0, which means we autoscale down to 0 whenever your endpoint is not receiving requests from your users and the timeout period has passed (this is a way to keep your costs down). Minimum replicas should be set to a higher number if you want to ensure highest uptime for your users and avoid cold starts. Cold start means there is currently no active container instance running inferences on our servers for your application, so we need to incur extra latency to spin up a new one.
- **Maximum Replicas:** This is an important measure for capping your maximum cost. The maximum number of replicas should be set based on how much simultaneous capacity you're willing to support at your heaviest traffic periods. For example, if you set your maximum replicas at 5, and each inference takes 1 second for your model on a GPU, then your application will be able to support a total of 250 inferences per minute without queueing. If your traffic goes above that level (well done you!), requests will be queued until they can be handled, which will increase your average request response time.
- **Timeout**: How many seconds to wait before we scale down your last replica since the time you have no more inferences running.

Now click **Create** and you’ll be directed to a page for your new endpoint.

To run an inference, use the endpoint URL shown in the UI, with the appropriate inference route appended to it. In our example, we serve inferences at the /predict route as defined in this [file](https://github.com/octoml/octocloud-templates/blob/main/flan-t5-small/server.py#L28), so we should send a CURL to `<your-endpont-url>/predict`. In my specific case, that is`https://flan-t5-small-01at11ru3fwy.octoai.run/predict`.

```bash bash
curl -X POST '<your-endpoint-url>/predict' --data '{"prompt": "What state is Los Angeles in?", "max_length": 100}' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_TOKEN"
```

- You need to edit the curl to use your own API token. If you don't have an existing token, refer to [how to create an OctoAI API Token](/docs/getting-started/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token)
- This model expects the inputs `prompt` and `max_length`. We can fill in values `"What state is Los Angeles in?"` and `100` for those fields respectively, and get a response back.
- To query the healthcheck for our endpoint (this is optional), we can hit `<your-endpoint-url>/healthcheck`

Once you use the curl to make an inference, look at the Events tab on the UI and you’ll see live events coming in informing you of the status of your deployment. Once you see here that the container is running, you inferences should complete successfully.",

Environment Variables: Just like secrets, these variables will be mounted onto the container at runtime. If you have a variable with key foo whose value is bar, you will get a variable foo whose value is bar mounted to the container.
Select hardware: We offer three tiers of hardware-- see Hardware, Pricing, and Billing for more information. Your choice of hardware determines the pricing that you will pay for your endpoint.
Minimum Replicas: The default minimum number of replicas is 0, which means we autoscale down to 0 whenever your endpoint is not receiving requests from your users and the timeout period has passed (this is a way to keep your costs down). Minimum replicas should be set to a higher number if you want to ensure highest uptime for your users and avoid cold starts. Cold start means there is currently no active container instance running inferences on our servers for your application, so we need to incur extra latency to spin up a new one.
Maximum Replicas: This is an important measure for capping your maximum cost. The maximum number of replicas should be set based on how much simultaneous capacity you're willing to support at your heaviest traffic periods. For example, if you set your maximum replicas at 5, and each inference takes 1 second for your model on a GPU, then your application will be able to support a total of 250 inferences per minute without queueing. If your traffic goes above that level (well done you!), requests will be queued until they can be handled, which will increase your average request response time.
Timeout: How many seconds to wait before we scale down your last replica since the time you have no more inferences running.

Now click Create and you’ll be directed to a page for your new endpoint.
To run an inference, use the endpoint URL shown in the UI, with the appropriate inference route appended to it. In our example, we serve inferences at the /predict route as defined in this file, so we should send a CURL to <your-endpont-url>/predict. In my specific case, that ishttps://flan-t5-small-01at11ru3fwy.octoai.run/predict.
curl -X POST '<your-endpoint-url>/predict' --data '{"prompt": "What state is Los Angeles in?", "max_length": 100}' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_TOKEN"


You need to edit the curl to use your own API token. If you don't have an existing token, refer to how to create an OctoAI API Token
This model expects the inputs prompt and max_length. We can fill in values "What state is Los Angeles in?" and 100 for those fields respectively, and get a response back.
To query the healthcheck for our endpoint (this is optional), we can hit <your-endpoint-url>/healthcheck

Once you use the curl to make an inference, look at the Events tab on the UI and you’ll see live events coming in informing you of the status of your deployment. Once you see here that the container is running, you inferences should complete successfully.

Overview
The octoai command-line interface (CLI) makes it easy for you create a custom endpoint for OctoAI Compute Service. The octoai CLI guides you through the process of creating an initial valid Python application with an example model, building it, and deploying it.
The octoai CLI includes some endpoint scaffolds with example models that you can deploy and try out right away. After you complete that initial workflow, you can follow the instructions in this document to modify the initial application to use the model or code of your choice on OctoAI Compute Service.
Prerequisites
Install the CLI and SDK
Follow CLI & SDK Installation to make sure you have the CLI and SDK installed. This guide assumes you are running the latest version of the octoai CLI.
Install Docker
Docker is required to build and push container images for custom endpoints.
For Mac, follow these instructions: Install Docker Desktop.
For Linux, follow these instructions: Install Docker Engine.
Make sure that docker is running before you proceed! You can confirm by running docker info.
Docker buildx is also required, and it is included with recent versions of Docker. You can confirm that you have it installed by looking for buildx in the output of docker info, or by running docker buildx.
Export Your OctoAI Token on the Terminal
An OctoAI token authenticates you when interacting with the OctoAI Compute Service programatically.
Go to OctoAI Compute Service and log in. Then:

Click Settings (the gear icon on the left).
Provide a name for your token under API Tokens.
Click Generate.
Copy the access token that appears.

On your terminal window, add the token as an environment variable:
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=<PasteYourOctoAITokenHere>

Create Your First Endpoint
Use the octoai CLI to create a directory on your computer with the application code for your first endpoint. Run this command:
octoai init

The CLI offers you to choose one of the existing scaffolds, which are endpoint examples ready to deploy that showcase how to use the service with different models. The following scaffolds are available:

hello-world (a simple example)
flan-t5 (text-in, text-out, adaptable to generative text use cases)
wav2vec (audio-in, text-out, adaptable for speech to text use cases)
yolov8 (image-in, image-out, adaptable for computer vision use cases)

Use the Up/Down arrow keys to navigate and choose a scaffold, then press Enter.
The rest of this section shows the deployment process using the hello-world scaffold. After you complete this tutorial, be sure to check out the other scaffolds to see how use different kinds models in your endpoints.
The CLI then prompts you for more details:

Directory: the directory name to create. Type hello-world and press Enter.
Endpoint name: the name of the endpoint. Type hello-world and press Enter.
Hardware: which hardware to run on. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select gpu.t4.medium and press Enter
Secrets: the set of secrets to make available to your container. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select None/No more and press Enter.
Environment variables: the set of environment variables and their values to make available to your container. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select None/No more and press Enter.

For more information about secrets and environment variables, see Setting up secrets or environment variables for your custom endpoints.
The CLI shows the following guidance:
Initialized project in directory. Build your endpoint with:

	cd directory
	octoai build

You can configure your project by editing the octoai.yaml file.

For the OctoAI CLI developer documentation, please visit https://docs.octoai.cloud/docs/cli/cli-configuration-reference

Directory Structure
The hello-world directory contains the following files:

octoai.yaml - Stores the configuration of your endpoint to be used at deployment time.
requirements.txt - Lists any additional Python requirement packages for your application.
service.py - Contains the logic of your endpoint.
test_request.py - Contains example code to send requests to your endpoint.

Service Code Structure
The code in service.py looks like this:
"""Example OctoAI service scaffold: Hello World."""
from octoai.service import Service

class HelloService(Service):
    """An OctoAI service extends octoai.service.Service."""

    def setup(self):
        """Perform intialization."""
        print("Setting up.")

    def infer(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """Perform inference."""
        return prompt

The octoai.service.Service class is an abstract class that any endpoint has to implement.
The octoai.types package contains type definitions that help endpoints and clients work with data formats such as images and audio while communicating over HTTP.
The Service.setup() method is run at endpoint initialization. This method typically contains setup code that should not be run for every inference, such as downloading model weights from the network and making those available in a member variable in memory to be used by the Service.infer() method.
The Service.infer() method is run for every inference request. This method defines the interface of the endpoint (inputs, outputs, and their types) and contains code to perform inference with the model of your choice and return a response. Note that types and type annotations are required, as the OpenAPI specification for the endpoint is automatically generated from the parameters (names and types) and return type in the infer() method definition. The OpenAPI specification is available at /docs once the endpoint is deployed.
The APIs that are available to you (as well as other examples) are covered later in this document. For more information, see the API reference documentation.
Build your Endpoint
Inside the hello-world directory, run the following command:
octoai build

This command builds a Docker container for your endpoint. The first time you run this command, it can take a long time (~15 min), since this process has to download large amounts of data. Subsequent builds (of this endpoint or any other endpoint you create) on the same machine are much faster.
When the build completes, the octoai CLI shows the name of the image tag:
{"tag":"docker.io/YourDockerUserName/hello-world:SomeTag"}

The octoai CLI keeps track of this value for you, so you do not need to remember it.
Run Your Endpoint Locally
Before deploying your endpoint, you can run the container locally and send it a request to verify that it is working properly.
Target PlatformsThe images are built for target linux/amd64 so they can be deployed to OctoAI Compute Service. If your computer is of a different architecture (for example, an M1/M2 Macbook), running the container locally can be slow (up to 15 min for yolov8).The scaffolds included on the octoai CLI all work locally without a GPU. However, other models that require GPU acceleration may not run locally at all if a GPU is not available in your system.To test locally, run this command:
octoai run --command "python3 test_request.py"

The command octoai run --command "python3 test_request.py" does two things: it runs your endpoint container locally in the background, and it runs the python script test_request.py to send a request to the endpoint container. After a few seconds, the output should be similar to this:
{'output': 'Hello World!', ...}

Two-Terminal Workflow
During development, it is often useful to have one terminal running the endpoint and showing its logs while sending a request from a separate terminal. This helps you iterate on your code and clearly see client and server errors separately, so you can make the appropriate fixes. Follow these steps:
First, run octoai run -l. This runs the endpoint in the foreground and displays the server logs as they occur. If there are any issues with your endpoint implementation code, you will see errors here either at initialization or when processing client requests.
$ octoai run -l
Starting container: octoai-local-6585
Initializing container: octoai-local-6585
Running container in foreground
2023-10-10 18:24:46,529 INFO server.py:638 run
2023-10-10 18:24:46,532 INFO server.py:520 Using service in service.HelloService.
2023-10-10 18:24:46,534 INFO server.py:520 Using service in service.HelloService.
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
2023-10-10 18:24:46,545 INFO server.py:347 status: State.UNINITIALIZED -> State.LAUNCH_PREDICT_LOOP
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
2023-10-10 18:24:47,027 INFO server.py:347 status: State.LAUNCH_PREDICT_LOOP -> State.SETUP_SERVICE
2023-10-10 18:24:47,028 INFO server.py:347 status: State.SETUP_SERVICE -> State.RUNNING

Second, open a new terminal and run python3 test_request.py. This runs the Python client code that sends a request to your endpoint. You typically will see the same response as before, but if there are errors returned to the client, you will see them here.
$ python3 test_request.py
{'output': 'Hello world!', 'analytics': {'inference_time_ms': 5.74e-06, 'performance_time_ms': 0.694469}}

Deploy Your Endpoint
To deploy your endpoint, run this command:
octoai deploy

This command reads the endpoint configuration from octoai.yaml and uses those settings to create the endpoint. After reading the endpoint configuration, this command pushes your container to Docker Hub. If this is the first endpoint you created, this may take a while depending on the speed of your internet connection. When the push is complete, the CLI shows you the URL of your new endpoint:
{"name":"hello-world", "endpoint": "https://hello-world-<hash>.octoai.run"}

The endpoint URL starts with your endpoint name and has additional characters added (shown as <hash> in the example above).
You can now verify your endpoint has been created with:
octoai endpoint list

Modify Your Endpoint
The octoai CLI stores your deployment configuration in the octai.yaml configuration file. Initially this file is populated using the answers to the prompts that you provided when running octoai init:
endpoint_config:
  name: hello-world
  hardware: gpu.t4.medium
  registry:
    host: docker.io
    path: <YourDockerHubUserName>/hello-world

The configuration file supports additional directives that enable you to customize different aspects of your deployment. For example, you can specify your maximum number of replicas:
endpoint_config:
  name: hello-world
  hardware: gpu.t4.medium
  max-replicas: 5
  registry:
    host: docker.io
    path: <YourDockerHubUserName>/hello-world

Then you can redeploy your endpoint:
octoai deploy

You can verify that the endpoint has been updated:
octoai endpoint list

Notice that the REPLICAS field now shows [0-5] instead of [0-3] as was the previous default.
For a list of all supported configuration directives, see the Configuration Reference section.
Send a Request to Your Endpoint
Ensure you installed the OctoAI Python SDK. Then, to send a request to your endpoint:
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=(paste your OctoAI API token from octoai.cloud/settings)
python3 test_request.py --endpoint https://hello-world-<hash>.octoai.run

When you first send this request, your endpoint is performing a cold start, which means that no replicas were running and the first one has to start and load your container. This may take one to two minutes for the example scaffolds. After this time, you should see a response similar to this:
{'output': 'Hello World!', ...}

Once you have an active replica, you can run the test command repeatedly and the endpoint responds quickly. OctoAI Compute Service lets you control the minimum and maximum number of replicas for your endpoint either from the web user interface or from the octoai CLI:

To see your endpoint in the web user interface, go to https://octoai.cloud/endpoints. Then click hello-world. To edit the endpoint, click Edit. On the next screen you can set the minimum and maximum number of replicas.
To use the CLI to update the minimum and maximum number of replicas, you can edit the octoai.yaml configuration file and redeploy your endpoint with octoai deploy.

Congratulations! You have now created your first endpoint on OctoAI Compute Service and ran remote inference.
Client Code Structure
The client code in test_request.py looks like this:
from octoai.client import OctoAI

inputs = {"prompt": "Hello world!"}

def main(endpoint):
    """Run inference against the endpoint."""
    # create an OctoAI client
    client = OctoAI()

    # perform inference
    response = client.infer(endpoint_url=f"{endpoint}/infer", inputs=inputs)

    # show the response
    print(response)

The octoai.client.Client class enables you to query your endpoint as shown here.
View Endpoint Logs
Now that your endpoint has served one inference, there are some logs available for you to view. OctoAI Compute Service lets you view the server logs for your endpoint using the web user interface or the octoai CLI:

To view the server logs using the web interface, go to https://octoai.cloud/endpoints. Then click hello-world. Then click the Logs button on the top right of the page.
To view the server logs using the CLI, use the octoai logs --name hello-world command.

For example, using the CLI the logs look similar to this:
$ octoai logs --name hello-world
19s   hello-world-<hash>   octoai server
18s   hello-world-<hash>   Using service in service.HelloService.
18s   hello-world-<hash>   run
18s   hello-world-<hash>   Setting up.
15s   hello-world-<hash>   Started server process [1]
15s   hello-world-<hash>   Waiting for application startup.
15s   hello-world-<hash>   Application startup complete.
15s   hello-world-<hash>   Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
13s   hello-world-<hash>   1.2.3.4:1234 - "POST /infer HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

Customize Your Endpoint
Once you have built and deployed a hello-world endpoint to OctoAI Compute Service, it is time to customize the endpoint for your use case. To customize your endpoint, you will need:

A list Python dependencies for your model of interest
Example Python code to load your model of interest
Example Python code to perform inference with your model of interest

Then you can modify the Hello World endpoint implementation to call your model of interest instead. Depending on the modality of your model of interest, it may be easier to start with a different scaffold than hello-world (such as flan-t5, wav2vec, or yolov8).
Use a HuggingFace Model
This section shows you how to modify the hello-world endpoint implementation to call the Flan-T5 model from HuggingFace instead. You can follow the process outlined here to use any other HuggingFace model of your interest.
Step 1: Add Python Requirements
The hello-world endpoint implementation contains an empty requirements.txt file.
Edit this file and add the corresponding requirements for Flan-T5:
sentencepiece==0.1.99
torch==2.0.1
transformers==4.29.2

Step 2: Add Custom Model Code
The hello-world endpoint implementation has an empty Service.setup() method in service.py, since it does not use any model, and a trivial Service.infer() method.
Edit service.py and add the required imports, the model loading code, and the model inferencing code:
# add these imports
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

from octoai.service import Service

class T5Service(Service):
    """An OctoAI service extends octoai.service.Service."""

    # update this method as shown here
    def setup(self):
        """Download model weights to disk."""
        self.tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
        self.model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")

    # update this method as shown here
    def infer(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """Perform inference with the model."""
        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model.generate(**inputs)
        response = self.tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)

        return response[0]

In this case, our model of interest is of the same modality as the hello-world examples. For more information on how to use other modalities, see Send and Receive Images and Send and Receive Audio.
Step 3: Modify Sample Client Code
The hello-world endpoint implementation has a sample test_request.py that makes a request to your endpoint. In this case, our model of interest is of the same modality as the hello-world example, so you can just change the prompt.
import argparse

from octoai.client import OctoAI

inputs = {"prompt": "What country is California in?"}
...

Step 4: Modify the Deployment Configuration
The hello-world endpoint implementation has a minimal octoai.yaml file.
Update it to change the endpoint name and image tag:
endpoint_config:
  name: flan-t5
  hardware: gpu.t4.medium
  regcred-key: dockerhub
  registry:
    host: docker.io
    path: <YourDockerHubUserName>/flan-t5

Step 5: Build and Deploy
Once you have modified the endpoint implementation, rebuild and test your endpoint:
octoai build
octoai run --command "python3 test_request.py"

Then, deploy your updated endpoint:
octoai deploy
octoai endpoint list
python3 test_request.py --endpoint https://flan-t5-<hash>.octoai.run

Congratulations! You have now customized your first endpoint on OctoAI Compute Service.
Modify the Dockerfile
The octoai CLI generates and uses a pre-defined Dockerfile to build a container for your endpoint. The CLI does not expose this Dockerfile by default, since most endpoints can be created successfully without having to view or change this file. However, the octoai CLI provides options for you to view and modify the Dockerfile if your use case requires it. For example, your model may require that you install additional native libraries in the container.
Keep in mind that you do not need to view or modify the Dockerfile to specify Python dependencies, since you can provide those in the requirements.txt file in your project directory.
To view and modify the Dockerfile:

Inside your project directory, run octoai build -g. Instead of building the container, this command generates a Dockerfile inside your project directory.
Inspect and modify the resulting Dockerfile as needed.
Build your container with octoai build. The build command uses the Dockerfile in your project directory to build your container (if one is available), instead of the pre-defined one. Note that using your own Dockerfile can increase cold start times for your endpoint. Contact us if you would like assistance on this subject.

Older versions and the -d flagVersions of octoai prior to 0.4.5 require that you build with the -d flag to use your custom Dockerfile. Versions 0.4.5 and above always use a custom Dockerfile if it is available in the project directory.
After you have built the container for your endpoint using a customized Dockerfile, you can continue with deployment in the same manner as before by running octoai deploy.
Include Model Weights in the Container
The Service.setup() method typically contains code that downloads model weights to disk. When you build an endpoint as described so far, this method is called right after the server starts, and the weights are downloaded to disk before the server can serve the first request.
The octoai CLI also enables you to run Service.setup() at container build time, such that the model weights downloaded to the local filesystem become part of the container image instead. In most cases, there is no clear benefit to embedding your weights with the container, since the container image will be larger and take longer to download, even if the server can serve requests soon after starting.
To include your model weights in your container image, add the --setup option to octoai build:
octoai build --setup

Send and Receive Images
The octoai.types package contains helpful classes if you are customizing your endpoint to use a model that receives or generates images. To define an endpoint for a model that receives or generates images in service.py, use the Image type as a parameter or return type in the Service.infer() signature. For example, this would be for a model that takes images as Python Pillow objects as input and generates text
from octoai.service import Service

class MyService(Service):

    def infer(self, image: Image) -> str:
        image_pil = image.to_pil()
        output = self.model(image_pil)

        return output[0]

For a detailed example on how to send and receive images, see the yolov8 scaffold when running octoai init. For a list of useful methods available to send and receive images, see the API reference documentation.
Send and Receive Audio
The octoai.types package contains helpful classes if you are customizing your endpoint to use a model that receives or generates audio. To define an endpoint for a model that receives or generates audio in service.py, use the Audio type as a parameter or return type in the Service.infer() signature. For example, this would be for a model that takes audio as input and generates text:
from octoai.service import Service
from octoai.types import Audio

class MyService(Service):

    def infer(self, audio: Audio) -> str:
        audio_array, sampling_rate = audio.to_numpy()
        output = self.model(audio_array, sampling_rate)

        return output[0]

For a detailed example on how to send and receive audio, see the wav2vec scaffold when running octoai init. For a list of useful methods available to send and receive audio, see the API Reference documentation.
Send and Receive Video
The octoai.types package contains helpful classes if you are customizing your endpoint to use a model that receives or generates video. To define an endpoint for a model that receives or generates video in service.py, use the Video type as a parameter or return type in the Service.infer() signature. For example, this would be for a model that takes video as input and generates text:
from octoai.service import Service
from octoai.types import Video

class MyService(Service):

    def infer(self, video: Video) -> str:
        video_frames = video.to_numpy()
        output = self.model(video_frames)

        return output[0]

For a list of useful methods available to send and receive video, see the API Reference documentation. The Video type was added in SDK version 0.5.0.
Send Media as URL References
You can create instances of the pre-defined media types (Image, Audio, and Video) from local files and from remote HTTP URLs.
The first approach is the .from_file() function, such as Image.from_file("my_file.jpg"). When you send an Image object created like this to your endpoint, the image data is encoded as base64. This approach is advantageous when your media assets are not available as remote URLs already or when you are working with smaller files, such that the base64 encoding and decoding penalty is small.
The second approach is the .from_url() function, such as Image.from_url("http://myserver.net/my_file.jpg"). When you send an Image object created like this to your endpoint, the image data is not included in the request, just the URL reference is. Inside your endpoint implementation, when you call methods that need the image data, such as Image.to_pil(), the image is downloaded then and data is accessed. This approach is advantageous when your media assets are already available as remote URLs or when you are working with large files, such that the base64 encoding and decoding penalty is noticeable.
For more information, see the API Reference documentation. Support for URL media references was added in SDK version 0.5.0.
Send Binary Files as Form Data
In addition to sending media either as base-64 encoded data or as URL references as described in the previous sections, you can also define an additional API route for your model that accepts form data. You can use this feature to upload any kind of binary file directly to your model.
To support form data uploads, you implement the Service.infer_form_data() method in your endpoint. For example:
from typing import Any, Dict

from octoai.service import Service, path
from octoai.types import File

class FormDataService(Service):
    def setup(self):
        print("Setting up FormDataService")

    def infer(self, data: str) -> str:
        # the endpoint will expose both methods
        return "Use /infer-form-data for form data inference"

    @path("/infer-form-data")
    def infer_form_data(self, file: File, metadata: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # this simple example shows the file information
        # you can instead send the file contents to your model
        return {
            "file_name": file.filename,
            "file_content_type": file.content_type,
            "file_size": file.size,
            "metadata": metadata,
        }

You can customize the API route where your implementation of infer_form_data will be exposed within your endpoint using the @path() annotation.
Argument Types for Form DataThe Service.infer_form_data() signature can only contain arguments of types octoai.types.File or str. If you need to provide additional metadata with your files, such as a JSON object, you can serialize it as a string so you can receive it inside the service implementation.
To send a file with some metadata to the endpoint implementation in the previous example, you can use the httpx library as follows.
import httpx

response = httpx.post(
    "https://<your-endpoint>.octoai.run/infer-form-data",
    files={"file": open("audio.wav", "rb")},
    data={"metadata": "Some info about this audio file"},
)

Support Multiple Routes
The OctoAI SDK enables you to define additional routes in your endpoint. The following example shows how to define two additional endpoints in a Service implementation:
from octoai.service import Service, path

class MultipleRoutesService(Service):

  def setup(self):
    print("Setting up MultipleRoutesService")

  # the infer() endpoint is always required
  def infer(self, prompt: str) -> str:
    return prompt

  # this method is exposed as /new-route
  @path("/new-route")
  def my_new_route(self, input_text: str):
    return input_text

  # this method is exposed as /my-new-route2
  def my_new_route2(self, input_text: str):
    return input_text

You can customize the path where new methods are exposed by specifying the @path annotation. If you do not provide this annotation, the method will be exposed using the method name with underscores replaced by dashes.
This feature was introduced in SDK version 0.7.2 (CLI version 0.5.8).

  service-module: app.service   # Path to python module to run (optional); defaults to "service"

Appendix: OpenAPI Specification and Pydantic Types
Endpoints that you create using the octoai CLI expose the signature of your Service.infer() method as an OpenAPI specification that is exposed in the /docs HTTP path of your endpoint. Clients of your endpoint can reference this API specification to understand how to query your endpoint using the correct input names and types, as well as identify the type of the output that your endpoint returns.
For most models, you can use primitive Python types and the pre-defined types (Image, Audio, and Video) from the OctoAI Python SDK in your Service.infer() signature. However, some models use custom schemas in some of their inputs or outputs. For example, the YOLOv8 model included in one of the scaffolds returns a list of predictions that have the following schema:
[{
    'name': 'bus',
    'class': 5,
    'confidence': 0.95,
    'box': {
        'x1': 2.91,
        'x2': 809.51,
        'y1': 230.68,
        'y2': 881.00
    }
}, ...]

For a model like this, you could define your return type as a list of dictionaries:
def infer(self, image: Image) -> Dict[str, Any]:

However, the OpenAPI specification that the endpoint provides to your client would not give them any information about the schema of the predictions. To address this limitation, the OctoAI Python SDK enables you to define custom entity classes using Pydantic models to capture these schemas and include them in the OpenAPI specification of the endpoint. For example, the YOLOv8 scaffold that you can select when creating a new endpoint with octoai init defines the following entities to capture the structure of the prediction shown above:
class Box(BaseModel):
    """Represents corners of a detection box."""

    x1: float
    x2: float
    y1: float
    y2: float

class Detection(BaseModel):
    """Represents a detection."""

    name: str
    class_: int = Field(..., alias="class")
    confidence: float
    box: Box

class YOLOResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response includes list of detections and rendered image."""

    detections: List[Detection]
    image_with_boxes: Image

Then the infer() signature in the YOLOv8Service implementation returns a YOLOResponse:
def infer(self, image: Image) -> YOLOResponse:
    ...
    # Return detection data and a rendered image with boxes
    return YOLOResponse(
        detections=[Detection(**d) for d in detections],
        image_with_boxes=Image.from_pil(img_out_pil),
    )

The YOLOResponse entity (and any other Pydantic model you use as a return type) is converted automatically to JSON before the endpoint sends it to the client.
For Pydantic models you use as input arguments in infer(), the JSON data that the client provides must conform to the parameters of the entity, and it is converted to a Pydantic object automatically.
Appendix: Using a Custom Docker Registry
Endpoints that you create with the octoai CLI use the OctoAI Compute Registry, which works seamlessly with your OctoAI authorization token. However, if you would prefer to use some other registry (such us DockerHub), you can configure your endpoint to do so.

Obtain your credentials for your custom registry. For example, for DockerHub, you can generate an access token from the Account Settings page.
Log into Docker on your terminal. Use the docker login command with your registry username and access token as your password.
Provide your registry credentials to the OctoAI Compute Service. To provide registry credentials using the web UI, see Pulling containers from a private registry. To provide registry credentials using the octoai CLI, use the octoai regcred create command. To verify your registry credentials were created correctly, use the octoai regcred list command.

To create a new endpoint that uses a custom Docker registry, issue the --registry option to the octoai init command with the registry URL. For example, for DockerHub:
octoai init --registry docker.io

The CLI will then prompt you for the image repository namespace (such as your DockerHub username) and the image repository name (which you could set to be the same as your endpoint name, or similar). Then the CLI will let you choose the right credentials to use to authenticate with the registry.",

The Service.infer() method is run for every inference request. This method defines the interface of the endpoint (inputs, outputs, and their types) and contains code to perform inference with the model of your choice and return a response. Note that types and type annotations are required, as the OpenAPI specification for the endpoint is automatically generated from the parameters (names and types) and return type in the infer() method definition.

Keep in mind that you do not need to view or modify the Dockerfile to specify Python dependencies, since you can provide those in the requirements.txt file in your project directory.
To view and modify the Dockerfile:

Inside your project directory, run octoai build -g. Instead of building the container, this command generates a Dockerfile inside your project directory.
Inspect and modify the resulting Dockerfile as needed.
Build your container with octoai build. The build command uses the Dockerfile in your project directory to build your container (if one is available), instead of the pre-defined one. Note that using your own Dockerfile can increase cold start times for your endpoint. Contact us if you would like assistance on this subject.

Clients of your endpoint can reference this API specification to understand how to query your endpoint using the correct input names and types, as well as identify the type of the output that your endpoint returns.
For most models, you can use primitive Python types and the pre-defined types (Image, Audio, and Video) from the OctoAI Python SDK in your Service.infer() signature. However, some models use custom schemas in some of their inputs or outputs. For example, the YOLOv8 model included in one of the scaffolds returns a list of predictions that have the following schema:
[{
    'name': 'bus',
    'class': 5,
    'confidence': 0.95,
    'box': {
        'x1': 2.91,
        'x2': 809.51,
        'y1': 230.68,
        'y2': 881.00
    }
}, ...]

For a model like this, you could define your return type as a list of dictionaries:
def infer(self, image: Image) -> Dict[str, Any]:

However, the OpenAPI specification that the endpoint provides to your client would not give them any information about the schema of the predictions. To address this limitation, the OctoAI Python SDK enables you to define custom entity classes using Pydantic models to capture these schemas and include them in the OpenAPI specification of the endpoint. For example, the YOLOv8 scaffold that you can select when creating a new endpoint with octoai init defines the following entities to capture the structure of the prediction shown above:
class Box(BaseModel):
    """Represents corners of a detection box."""

    x1: float
    x2: float
    y1: float
    y2: float

class Detection(BaseModel):
    """Represents a detection."""

    name: str
    class_: int = Field(..., alias="class")
    confidence: float
    box: Box

class YOLOResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response includes list of detections and rendered image."""

    detections: List[Detection]
    image_with_boxes: Image

Then the infer() signature in the YOLOv8Service implementation returns a YOLOResponse:
def infer(self, image: Image) -> YOLOResponse:
    ...
    # Return detection data and a rendered image with boxes
    return YOLOResponse(
        detections=[Detection(**d) for d in detections],
        image_with_boxes=Image.from_pil(img_out_pil),
    )

The YOLOResponse entity (and any other Pydantic model you use as a return type) is converted automatically to JSON before the endpoint sends it to the client.
For Pydantic models you use as input arguments in infer(), the JSON data that the client provides must conform to the parameters of the entity, and it is converted to a Pydantic object automatically.",

Step-by-step walkthrough
Prepare Python code for running an inference
First, we define how to run an inference on this model in model.py. The core steps include initializing the model and tokenizer using the transformers Python library, then running a predict() function that tokenizes the text input, runs the model, then de-tokenizes the model back into a text format.
"""Model wrapper for serving flan-t5-small."""
import argparse
import typing

import torch
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

_MODEL_NAME = "google/flan-t5-small"
"""The model's name on HuggingFace."""

_DEVICE: str = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
"""Device on which to serve the model."""

class Model:
    """Wrapper for a flan-t5-small Text Generation model."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the model."""
        self._tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(_MODEL_NAME)
        self._model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(_MODEL_NAME).to(
            _DEVICE
        )

    def predict(self, inputs: typing.Dict[str, str]) -> typing.Dict[str, str]:
        """Return a dict containing the completion of the given prompt.

        :param inputs: dict of inputs containing a prompt and optionally the max length
            of the completion to generate.
        :return: a dict containing the generated completion.
        """
        prompt = inputs.get("prompt", None)
        max_length = inputs.get("max_length", 2048)

        input_ids = self._tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(_DEVICE)
        output = self._model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length)
        result = self._tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

        return {"completion": result}

    @classmethod
    def fetch(cls) -> None:
        """Pre-fetches the model for implicit caching by Transfomers."""
        # Running the constructor is enough to fetch this model.
        cls()

def main():
    """Entry point for interacting with this model via CLI."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--fetch", action="store_true")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.fetch:
        Model.fetch()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Create a server
Next, we wrap this model in a Sanic server in server.py. Sanic is a Python 3.7+ web server and web framework that’s written to go fast. In our server file, we define the following:

A default port on which to serve inferences. The port can be any positive number, as long as it's not in use by another application. 80 is commonly used for HTTP, and 443 is often for HTTPS. In this case we choose 8000.
Two server routes that OctoAI containers should have:

a route for inference requests (e.g. "/predict"). This route for inference requests must receive JSON inputs and JSON outputs.
a route for health checks (e.g. "/healthcheck"). See Healthcheck path in custom containers for a detailed explanation.


Number of workers (not required). Typical best practice is to make this number some function of the # of CPU cores that the server has access to and should use.

"""HTTP Inference serving interface using sanic."""
import os

import model
from sanic import Request, Sanic, response

_DEFAULT_PORT = 8000
"""Default port to serve inference on."""

# Load and initialize the model on startup globally, so it can be reused.
model_instance = model.Model()
"""Global instance of the model to serve."""

server = Sanic("server")
"""Global instance of the web server."""

@server.route("/healthcheck", methods=["GET"])
def healthcheck(_: Request) -> response.JSONResponse:
    """Responds to healthcheck requests.

    :param request: the incoming healthcheck request.
    :return: json responding to the healthcheck.
    """
    return response.json({"healthy": "yes"})

@server.route("/predict", methods=["POST"])
def predict(request: Request) -> response.JSONResponse:
    """Responds to inference/prediction requests.

    :param request: the incoming request containing inputs for the model.
    :return: json containing the inference results.
    """
    inputs = request.json
    output = model_instance.predict(inputs)
    return response.json(output)

def main():
    """Entry point for the server."""
    port = int(os.environ.get("SERVING_PORT", _DEFAULT_PORT))
    server.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port, workers=1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

In our toy example, the line model_instance = model.Model() executes first, so by the time the server is instantiated our model is ready. That is why the code in our "/healthcheck" route is very straightforward in this example. In your own container, make sure your "/healthcheck" returns 200 only after your model is fully loaded and ready to take inferences.
Package the server in a Dockerfile
Now we can package the server by defining a requirements.txt file and a Dockerfile:
sanic==23.3.0
torch==2.0.0+cu118
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
sentencepiece==0.1.97
transformers==4.27.4

FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04

ARG SERVING_PORT=8000
ENV SERVING_PORT=$SERVING_PORT

WORKDIR /

RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y python3-pip

# Upgrade pip and install the copied in requirements.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
ADD requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy in the files necessary to fetch, run and serve the model.
ADD model.py .
ADD server.py .

# Fetch the model and cache it locally.
RUN python3 model.py --fetch

# Expose the serving port.
EXPOSE $SERVING_PORT

# Run the server to handle inference requests.
CMD python3 -u server.py

Along with installing the dependencies, the Dockerfile also downloads the model into the image at build time. Because the model isn't too big, we can cache it in the Docker image for faster startup without impacting the image size too much. If your model is larger, you may want to pull it on container start instead of caching it in the Docker image. This may affect your container startup time, but keeps the image itself slim.
Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile
$ DOCKER_REGISTRY="XXX" # Put your Docker Hub username here
$ cd ./flan-t5-small
$ docker build -t "$DOCKER_REGISTRY/flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic" -f Dockerfile .

Test the image locally
Run this Docker image locally on a GPU to test that it can run inferences as expected:
$ docker run --gpus=all -d --rm
    -p 8000:8000 --env SERVER_PORT=8000
    --name "flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic"
  	"$DOCKER_REGISTRY/flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic"

..and in a separate terminal run the following command one or more times
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/healthcheck

... until you see {"healthy":true} in the terminal output. Now, you can get an inference by running:
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"prompt":"What state is Los Angeles in?","max_length":100}'

Push the image to a cloud registry
Push your Docker image to Docker Hub with:
$ docker push "$DOCKER_REGISTRY/flan-t5-small-pytorch-sanic"

Now that you have your container, create an endpoint to establish your endpoint on OctoAI.

Required-by:

Uninstall the CLI and Python SDK
Our installation script installs the OctoAI binary to usr/local/bin. You can remove it with:
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/octoai

You can uninstall the Python SDK using:
python3 -m pip uninstall octoai-sdk

If you used another method of installation such as brew, rpm, etc, please follow the directions from those services.
If you choose not to install the CLI and SDK using the installation script, you can alternatively use brew or apt. For most people, it is recommended you use the installation script.
Please note, if you install the CLI using brew or apt, you will also need to install the SDK directly from PIP. You can review the installation shell script from CLI & SDK Installation to verify a compatible SDK version number if you run into difficulties, and also review there how to verify the installation was successful for both the SDK and CLI.
Latest Python SDK Release
Much of the CLI is dependent on the SDK. You can view our full release history on PyPI here.
If you choose not to use the installation script, you can use pip to install the octoai-sdk Python package directly. We strongly recommend that you install OctoAI in a virtualenv, to avoid conflicting with your system packages.
python3 -m pip install octoai-sdk

If you've already installed a previous version of the octoai-sdk, you can also upgrade using:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade octoai-sdk

Alternate CLI Installation Options
After installing the Python SDK, you can then install the CLI.
Mac:
brew tap octoml/tap
brew install octoai

Debian:
sudo add-apt-repository -y 'deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.fury.io/octoml/ /'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install octoai

The SDK currently supports Python versions 3.8.1 and upwards. It is strongly recommended that you use a virtual environment such as Conda or venv to manage Python packages for your development environment. This helps prevent incompatible dependencies with packages installed irrelevant to your current project or that conflict with system dependencies.
You can view our full release history on PyPi for the latest version of the Python SDK.
For Mac and Linux, use pip to install the octoai sdk Python package. We strongly recommend that you install OctoAI in a virtualenv, to avoid conflicting with your system packages.
python3 -m pip install octoai

Please refer to CLI & SDK Installation for how to install the SDK in conjunction with the CLI for the authoring tool.
Setting API token as an environment variable
In order to access endpoints, create an OctoAI API token. Set OCTOAI_TOKEN to the token value wherever you set your environment variables, such as your .bashrc or .env file.
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

Then when you instantiate the client, it will detect the OCTOAI_TOKEN as an envvar and set it for you.
from octoai.client import OctoAI

client = OctoAI()

Alternatively, on creation of the OctoAI class, you can set your token, or the Client also accepts a path to where you've stored your API token from the config_path variable. Please see the OctoAI docs for more information.

Upgrading your code

from octoai.client import OctoAI

client = OctoAI()

# The various APIs are now accessible from the client
client.text_gen

client.image_gen

client.fine_tuning

client.asset_library

Image Generation API changes
In the octoai.image_gen API instead of specifying which
engine to use, use the corresponding generate_* method.
Text Generation API changes
The text generation models with octoai.text_gen API are now specified with a str model name instead of an enum.
Streaming requests are made with the corresponding octoai.text_gen.*_stream method.
Asset Library (Asset Orchestrator) API changes
The Asset Orchestrator has been renamed to Asset Library and can be accessed via octoai.asset_library. Assets can be created with the octoai.asset_lirbary.create_from_file.
octoai.service API changes
The octoai.service API has been removed. You can make inferences to compute service endpoints via OctoAI client:
from octoai.client import OctoAI

client = OctoAI()

# octoai.infer()

However you will need to continue to use the older octoai-sdk for the full octoai.service API which includes service authoring.",

Image Generation API changes
In the octoai.imageGen API, instead of specifying which engine to use, use the corresponding generate* method such as generateSdxl() or generateSd().
Text Generation API changes
The text generation models with octoai.textGen API are now specified with a string model name instead of an enum.
Streaming requests are made with the corresponding octoai.textGen.*Stream method such as createCompletionStream() or createChatCompletionStream().
Asset Library (Asset Orchestrator) API changes
The Asset Orchestrator has been renamed to Asset Library and can be accessed via octoai.assetLibrary. Assets can be created with the octoai.assetLibrary.upload() method.
Compute Inferencing API changes

Create inference
POST https://image.octoai.run/generate/sdxl

Starts an inference at the specified endpoint URL for the data inputs you provide. The request is synchronous by default, and you can optionally specify the request as asynchronous. Input parameters are included in the cURL example of each endpoint.
API requests to your endpoints must be authenticated with a token - you can generate a token from the Account Settings page. Be sure to include your token in the header of your requests.
Example synchronous cURL request:
curl -X POST "https://image.octoai.run/generate/sdxl" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "authorization: Bearer $OCTOAI_TOKEN" \
 --data-raw '{"prompt": "A photo of a cute cat astronaut in space"}'

Asynchronous inference
You can create an asynchronous inference by specifying X-OctoAI-Async: 1 in the request header.
Example asynchronous cURL request:
curl -X POST "https://image.octoai.run/generate/sdxl" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "authorization: Bearer $OCTOAI_TOKEN" \
 -H "X-OctoAI-Async:1" \
 --data-raw '{"prompt": "A photo of a cute cat astronaut in space"}'

"poll_url": "https://async.octoai.run/v1/requests/778bbfd58c-hz95k"

Get inference
Poll for status
GET https://async.octoai.run/v1/requests/response_id

Use the poll_url to return the status of an inference, which will be one of these values:

pending: the inference is waiting or starting up
running: the inference is in progress
completed: the inference is finished

Example poll cURL request:
curl -X GET "https://async.octoai.run/v1/requests/778bbfd58c-hz95k" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCTOAI_TOKEN"

Example pending poll response:

LangChain provides a framework to easily build LLM-powered apps. Developers using LangChain can now utilize OctoAI LLMs and Embedding endpoints
to access efficient, fast, and reliable compute.
Using OctoAI's LLMs and LangChain
To use OctoAI LLMs with LangChain, first obtain an OcotoAI API Token.
Then paste your API token in the code example below:
import os

os.environ["OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"] = "OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"
os.environ["ENDPOINT_URL"] = "https://text.octoai.run/v1/chat/completions"

Next, run the following Python script:
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms.octoai_endpoint import OctoAIEndpoint
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n Instruction:\n{question}\n Response: """
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

llm = OctoAIEndpoint(
    model_kwargs={
        "model": "llama-2-13b-chat-fp16",

        ],
    },
)

question = "Who was leonardo davinci?"

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

print(llm_chain.run(question))

It should produce the following output:
  Sure thing! Here's my response:

Leonardo da Vinci was a true Renaissance man - an Italian polymath who excelled in various fields,
including painting, sculpture, engineering, mathematics, anatomy, and geology. He is widely considered
one of the greatest painters of all time, and his inventive and innovative works continue to inspire and
influence artists and thinkers to this day. Some of his most famous works include the Mona Lisa,
The Last Supper, and Vitruvian Man.

Unstructured is both an open-source library and an API service. The library provides components for ingesting and pre-processing images and text documents, such as PDFs, HTML, Word docs, and many more.
It also provides components to very easily embed these documents. In Unstructured’s jargon this component is called an EmbeddingEncoder. The OctoAIEmbedingEncoder is available, so documents parsed with Unstructured can easily be embedded with the OctoAI embeddings endpoint.
Using the OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder
Before you get started let's review some concepts. You will need an OctoAI API Token for this integration.

The OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder class connects to the OctoAI Text&Embedding API to obtain embeddings for pieces of text.
embed_documents will receive a list of Elements, and return an updated list which includes the embeddings attribute for each Element.
embed_query will receive a query as a string, and return a list of floats which is the embedding vector for the given query string.
num_of_dimensions is a metadata property that denotes the number of dimensions in any embedding vector obtained via this class.
is_unit_vector is a metadata property that denotes if embedding vectors obtained via this class are unit vectors.

Now, let's get started with the following code example for how to use OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder.
You will see the updated elements list (with the embeddings attribute included for each element),
the embedding vector for the query string, and some metadata properties about the embedding model.
You will need to set an environment variable named OCTOAI_API_KEY to be able to run this example.
import os

from unstructured.documents.elements import Text
from unstructured.embed.octoai import OctoAiEmbeddingConfig, OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder

embedding_encoder = OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder(
    config=OctoAiEmbeddingConfig(api_key=os.environ["OCTOAI_API_KEY"])
)
elements = embedding_encoder.embed_documents(
    elements=[Text("This is sentence 1"), Text("This is sentence 2")],
)

query = "This is the query"
query_embedding = embedding_encoder.embed_query(query=query)

[print(e.embeddings, e) for e in elements]
print(query_embedding, query)
print(embedding_encoder.is_unit_vector(), embedding_encoder.num_of_dimensions())

The OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder class connects to the OctoAI Text&Embedding API to obtain embeddings for pieces of text.
embed_documents will receive a list of Elements, and return an updated list which includes the embeddings attribute for each Element.
embed_query will receive a query as a string, and return a list of floats which is the embedding vector for the given query string.
num_of_dimensions is a metadata property that denotes the number of dimensions in any embedding vector obtained via this class.
is_unit_vector is a metadata property that denotes if embedding vectors obtained via this class are unit vectors.

Now, let's get started with the following code example for how to use OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder.
You will see the updated elements list (with the embeddings attribute included for each element),
the embedding vector for the query string, and some metadata properties about the embedding model.
You will need to set an environment variable named OCTOAI_API_KEY to be able to run this example.

OpenRouter provides a unified interface for using various LLMs and allows users to find and compare models based on PromiseRejectionEvent, latency, throughput.
This let's users find the right LLM and mix of price and performance for their use case.
Using OctoAI's LLMs and OpenRouter
To access OctoAI's best in class LLMs via OpenRouter sign into OpenRouter and create an account to obtain an OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
Using the code snippet below you can route your calls to OpenRouter via OpenAI's client API.
Set the providers the OpenRouter will use for your request using the order field. The router will filter this list to only include fproviders that are available for the model you want to use, and then try one at a time. It will fail if none are available.

Get started reviewing more about LlamaIndex, and signing up for a free OctoAI account.
LlamaIndex has both Python and TypScript libraries, and OctoAI is available in the Python SDK.
To use OctoAI LLM endpoints with LlamaIndex start with the code below using Llama 3 8B as the LLM.
from os import environ

OctoAI made improvements to SDXL endpoint, and added support to multi-user accounts.

We have improved OctoAI's SDXL. Our latency-optimized SDXL endpoints now take about 2.8s to generate a 30-step image. We also have a cost-optimized SDXL endpoint that takes about 8s for 30 steps.
Added support for multi-user accounts, which allows your team to manage endpoints, view logs & metrics, and securely share access to an account.

OctoAI made an addition to it's Github repo to help users start building your own app on OctoAI, and a new audio generation endpoint.

Check out our github repo for template applications to help you get started on building your own app with OctoAI. Right now, we have an example using Python and deployable on Streamlit as well as one using TypeScript and deployable on Vercel.
We also have a new audio generation endpoint available under private preview (e.g. Bark, Tortoise TTS).

OctoAI made several additions including: Llama 2 70B model, real-time streaming capabilities to Whisper, and updated the domain for newly created endpoints.


Added Llama2 70B quickstart template endpoint. We can also host custom Llama2 LoRAs/ checkpoints.


Enabled users to upload data via URL in the authoring experience (CLI + Python SDK)


Added real-time streaming capabilities to our Whisper audio flow, with a React hook called use Whisper for ease of integration into web/mobile apps. Learn more about this change.


Changed the domain for all newly created endpoints from octoai.cloud to octoai.run Existing endpoints on octoai.cloud will still work, but we suggest that you start changing your code to call endpoints from octoai.run instead of octoai.cloud, since we'll also update existing endpoints in about a month.


Improved
August 16, 2023
There were some new additions to our docs about Image Generation, some improvements in the backend, and a faster version of Stable Diffusion 1.5.


Added a new section in our Docs on Image Generation, including how to fine-tune and use Stable Diffusion.


Reduced cold start substantially on endpoints created with our authoring experience (can be multiple minutes of improvement depending on the model). Upgrade to the latest version of the CLI and SDK and author new endpoints to get faster cold start for your custom models.


Improved error boundaries in the UI. Users would be less likely to run into the "Whoops Beta Mode engaged" message in the UI.


Enabled concurrency handling improvements to all new endpoints created from now on. We will also be gradually rolling out this change on previously created endpoints in upcoming weeks.


A faster version of SD XL with dimension 1024x1024 is now available under private preview. We'd be gradually rolling out this new version over the next week or so.


Reminder: OctoAI's quickstart template endpoints are for demo/testing purposes only. On these endpoints, we rate-limit to 15 inferences per hour. If you would like to exceed this limit for production use, please clone the endpoint to your own account.


Added
August 10, 2023
There have been some additions to the OctoAI platform: Stable Diffusion 1.5 template feature additions, Whisper feature additions, and private registry updates.

Whisper Template Feature Additions: Multi-hour long audio files are now supported. Furthermore, you can specify a URL to the audio input file (e.g. MP3, WAV, or MP4 formats), instead of uploading a file from your local environment.
Private Registry: OctoAI's container authoring experience has been upgraded. Users are no longer required to provide registry credentials to get started. Images can be uploaded directly to a private OctoAI Registry. User uploaded images to OctoAI's Registry are accessible only to you and OctoAI services i.e. no other user can view or access your images.
Stable Diffusion 1.5 Template Feature Additions: OctoAI's Stable Diffusion endpoint, running on A10Gs, has been upgraded to include the following features to help users customize styling and achieve higher-quality images:

Popular Checkpoints like DreamShaper and Realistic Vision, Low Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), and Textual Inversions. Note: LoRA weights must sum up to 1.
Additional image dimensions.
We updated the web user interface.

OctoAI added several new things including better graceful concurrency handling, updated Python SDK, and diarization to Whisper model template.


Added more graceful concurrency handling: when users send more than N concurrent request to an endpoint with N replicas actively running, we will queue all extra requests instead of failing them. This queuing behavior has been activated for selected customers, and will be gradually rolled out over this week and next week. You will temporarily see a new replica spin up while the rollout is occurring on your endpoint.


Updated our Python SDK from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0—it now support both streaming and async inference requests.


Added diarization to our Whisper template endpoint and rectified the list of languages supported. Diarization enables use cases where you'd like to identify the speaker of each segment in a speech recording. You can view the full API specs in the Whisper demo template. Here's an example of how to use the template with diarization:

    import requests
    import base64

    def download_file(url, filename):
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            with open(filename, "wb") as f:
                f.write(response.content)
            print(f"File downloaded successfully as {filename}.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")


    def make_post_request(filename):
        with open(filename, "rb") as f:
            encoded_audio = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")

        headers = {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        data = {
            "audio": encoded_audio,
            "task": "transcribe",
            "diarize": True
        }

        response = requests.post("https://whisper-demo-kk0powt97tmb.octoai.cloud/predict", json=data, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Handle the successful response here
            json_response = response.json()

            for seg in json_response["response"]["segments"]:
                print(seg)

        else:
            print(f"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        url = "<YOUR_FILE_HERE>.wav"
        filename = "sample.wav"

        download_file(url, filename)

        make_post_request(filename)

Added an OctoAI template for Llama2-7B Chat.

Added an OctoAI template for Llama2-7B Chat, which is an instruction-tuned model for chatbots.
Users can now work with this brand-new to the market LLM directly in the web UI with limited
token response or programmatically with additional optionality. A similar template for Llama2-70B is coming soon!

Fixed
July 18, 2023
Changed the HTTP status code to 201 for the REST API calls for create secret and create registry credentials.  Previously, we returned 200 for these calls.

Added more graceful concurrency handling: when users send more than N concurrent request to an endpoint with N replicas actively running, we will queue all extra requests instead of failing them. This queuing behavior has been activated for selected customers, and will be gradually rolled out over this week and next week. You will temporarily see a new replica spin up while the rollout is occurring on your endpoint.


Updated our Python SDK from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0—it now support both streaming and async inference requests.


Added diarization to our Whisper template endpoint and rectified the list of languages supported. Diarization enables use cases where you'd like to identify the speaker of each segment in a speech recording. You can view the full API specs in the Whisper demo template. Here's an example of how to use the template with diarization:

    import requests
    import base64

    def download_file(url, filename):
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            with open(filename, "wb") as f:
                f.write(response.content)
            print(f"File downloaded successfully as {filename}.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")


    def make_post_request(filename):
        with open(filename, "rb") as f:
            encoded_audio = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")

New tutorials showing how to use Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion web UI and an updated Falcon template.


Released a Doc tutorial to show users how to use OctoAI's server class GPUs with Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion web user interface.


Released a video tutorial to show users how to apply custom model checkpoints using Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion web user interface on OctoAI.


Updated our Falcon template to use a different server implementation behind the scenes. The inference API is now available at /generate, but inferences at /predict will continue to work.


Added
June 14, 2023
We have launched OctoAI into general availability and made several updates to our models and endpoints.


With the launch of our service, changes will be made to our billing. You can find pricing plans and hardware options here. Changes and new user incentives taken into immediate effect are noted below:


Tomorrow, June 13th, any existing endpoints will be set to min replicas=0 so that you are not billed for an instance unintentionally left active and running. Be prepared for a cold start before your first inference and reset to min replicas=1 if you prefer to keep the instance warm.


Every user who logs in during public beta will receive credits for 2 free compute hrs on A100 (or 10+ hrs on A10!) to use in their first two weeks.


The first 500 users to create a new endpoint will receive credits for 12 free compute hrs on A100 (or 50+ hrs on A10!) to use within their first month.




You now have two options to integrate OctoAI endpoints into your application:


Our new Python client (supports synchronous inference).


Our HTTP REST API now supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls allowing users to request inference without persisting a connection, poll for status, and retrieve the completed prediction data. This is most effective when managing longer running requests.




We've updated our Whisper model to be much faster.


We've also added MPT 7B and Vicuña 7B as new quick-start templates as better alternatives to Dolly, which will be removed soon.


Added
June 6, 2023
Some additions to OctoAI on June 6, 2023. Added private registry and the ability for users to mount secrets and other environment variables.
Private registry control
Added the ability for users to pull containers from private registries by applying registry credentials to an endpoint. See Pulling containers from a private registry for a guide.
Secrets and environment variables
Added the ability for users to mount secrets and other environment variables into their containers within an endpoint. See Setting up secrets or environment variables for your custom endpoints for a guide.
A100 GPUs
NVIDIA A100s are back online as of 5pm PDT on June 6th. The A100s were temporarily taken down earlier this week as maintenance was being performed to update the version of CUDA. User requests and hardware options are now functioning business as usual.

## Request

### Body

- image=string Starting point image encoded in base64 string.
- height=integer? 
- width=integer? 
- cfg_scale=double? Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to 'image'. Must be a positive number no greater than 10.0.
- steps=integer? Integer repreenting how many steps of diffusion to run. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- motion_scale=double? A floating point number between 0.0 and 5.0 indicating how much motion should be in the generated video/animation.
- noise_aug_strength=double? A floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicatiing how much noise to add to the initial image. Higher values encourage
creativity.
- num_videos=integer? Integer representing how many output videos/animations to generate with a single 'image' and configuration.
- fps=integer? Integer representing how fast the generated frames should play back.
- seed=type_image-gen:VideoGenerationRequestSeed: unknown   | unknown   Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators.Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific video/animation (or set of videos/animations). Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.? Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators.Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to
generate a specific video/animation (or set of videos/animations). Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.
- enable_safety=boolean? Boolean defining whether to use safety checker system on generated outputs or not.
- force_asset_download=boolean? [Internal] Boolean defining if assets must be re-downloaded into the cache even if present.
- force_asset_gpu_copy=boolean? [Internal] Boolean defining if assets must to be copied into the GPU even if present.

## Path Parameters

- /adetailer
## Request

### Body

- init_image=string? 
- init_image_url=string? 
- image_encoding=type_:ImageEncoding: jpeg (),png () The image encoding types available for image modification response.? Define which encoding process should be applied before returning the modified image.
- transfer_images=Map<string, unknown?>? 
- prompt=string? 
- negative_prompt=string? 
- sampler=type_:Scheduler: PNDM (),LMS (),KLMS (),DDIM (),DDPM (),HEUN (),K_HEUN (),K_EULER (),K_EULER_ANCESTRAL (),DPM_SOLVER_MULTISTEP (),DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS (),DPM_SINGLE (),DPM_2 (),DPM_2_ANCESTRAL (),DPM_PLUS_PLUS_SDE_KARRAS (),UNI_PC (),LCM () The schedulers available for image generation.? 
- steps=integer? 
- inpainting_base_model=type_:ADetailerInpaintingBaseModel: sdxl (),sd15 () Base model which ADetailer should use for inpainting.? 
- checkpoint=string? 
- loras=Map<string, unknown?>? 
- use_refiner=boolean? 
- style_preset=string? 
- strength=double? 
- cfg_scale=double? Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to prompt description. Must be a positive number no greater than 50.0.
- seed=type_:ADetailerRequestSeed: unknown   | unknown   Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.? Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to
generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.
- mask_dilation=integer? A mask is created for each inpainted area in the image. Mask Dilation allows you to expand the size of the mask while maintaining
its shape. This technique is typically used to reduce artifacts near borders in the mask. This parameter is the size, in pixels,
of the dilation kernel to apply. Defaults to 4. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and recommended to be less than 64.
- mask_blur=integer? A mask is created for each inpainted area in the image. After dilation (see mask_dilation parameter), the mask is blurred. This
technique is typically used to smoothly blend the inpainted area with the original image. This option specifies the radius, in
pixels, of the gaussian blur kernel. The higher the value, the wider the blur. Defaults to 4. Must be greater than or equal to 0
and recommended to be less than 64.
- mask_padding=integer? Each inpainted area is passed to the image-to-image generator with some surrounding context. The contextual area is created by
padding the area occupied by the blurred, dilated mask. This technique improves inpainting quality, and the contextual area is not
modified. This parameter specifies the amount of padding, in pixels, to apply around the processed mask. When the computed padding
goes off the edge of the image, the padded area is slid towards the center of the image. Must be greater than or equal to 0 and
recommended to be less than 10% the size of an inpainting mask.
- max_num_detections=integer? 
- confidence=double? Inpainted areas are determined using a detector. This setting adjusts the sensitivity of the detector (lower considers more image
fragments for inpainting).
- detector=type_:ADetailerDetector: face_yolov8n (),hand_yolov8n (),face_full_mediapipe (),face_short_mediapipe (),face_mesh_mediapipe (),eyes_mesh_mediapipe (),face_hair_mediapipe () ADetailer detector models available. Detection model to use. Configures whether e.g. faces or hands or people are targeted for after-detailing.
- union_masks=boolean? When true, create a single mask by unioning the mask for each detected object together, then send a single inpainting request to
the backing model.
## Response
