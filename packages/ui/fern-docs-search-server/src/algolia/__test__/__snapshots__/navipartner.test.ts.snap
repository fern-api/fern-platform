Seamless Integration: Our API acts as a transparent layer, allowing you to interact with Business Central data and processes as if you were using a native REST API.

Enhanced Security: Authentication is handled directly against the Business Central instance, ensuring robust security measures are in place.

Rate Limiting: Be mindful of the rate limits set for the API to avoid throttling and ensure fair usage across all users.

Obtaining Parameter Values: If you're unsure about the correct values for these parameters, contact your Business Central administrator or the person who provided you with API access.

Security: Treat the saasguid as sensitive information, as it's a key identifier for the Business Central tenant.

 /ticketing/catalog/:storeCode 

The catalog endpoints serve as the foundation for a headless setup, offering a centralized way to access essential information
about the available tickets.
Key Concepts:
Store Code Parameter:
The store code acts as a filter, allowing the system to tailor the available ticket information to a specific
sales channel or store front. Each store or sales channel may have its own unique set of tickets
and the store code ensures that only the relevant subset of tickets is returned.
This is particularly useful in cases where different platforms, regions, or partners require distinct offerings.

Localized Storefront:
The store front is typically designed to target a specific language or region.
As a result, the catalog endpoint ensures that ticket information is delivered in the appropriate language for
the store's target audience. By supporting multiple languages, the system can accommodate global users
while ensuring that the presentation and messaging are localized.

Formatted Content Fields:
The catalog also supports two fields that can include HTML styling and formatting.
These fields provide flexibility for content presentation, allowing rich text formatting such as bold text,
lists, links, or other HTML elements.
This ensures that the ticket descriptions or other important information can be presented in an
engaging and readable way, enhancing the user experience across different devices or platforms.
It also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions
without requiring separate design templates for each store.",

 /ticketing/capacity/search 

The capacity API is responsible for managing the availability of access to a specific admission at a designated time,
ensuring the system can allocate resources for a ticket reservation.
Key Concepts:
Item Number:
This represents the product being sold at a high level.
Each item number corresponds to a category or type of ticket, and the base price is associated with
the item number. The base price is drawn from a general price list that applies across all similar items.

Admissions:
Admissions define the specific areas or events a ticket grants access to.
Each admission has a unique admission code, along with descriptive information and various predefined limits,
such as capacity or entry restrictions. These limits and policies can be set at different hierarchical levels,
allowing flexibility in how capacity is controlled.

Time-Based Validity:
In addition to defining what a ticket allows access to, the admission must also specify when the access is valid.
Every admission needs to be linked to a specific time slot to ensure proper scheduling.
In cases where the time is not explicitly provided, the system may assign a time slot automatically (defined by setup),
which is particularly useful for scenarios like walk-up ticket sales at kiosks,
where tickets should be valid immediately upon purchase.

Dynamic Pricing:
Each time slot can independently manage its pricing.
While the base price is determined by the item number, time slots can either use a fixed price or
apply dynamic pricing adjustments to the base price based on demand, capacity, or other factors.

Time Slot Visibility: All available time slots are displayed to the consumer, even if they are no longer
allocatable (e.g., fully booked or sold out). This is intentional, as it allows the system to provide
visibility into popular events, offering a sense of urgency or exclusivity that can drive consumer interest.",

Each ticket may permit entry to multiple admissions or sections, with the ticket details indicating which
specific areas or events the holder is entitled to access. When a ticket is validated upon arrival,
the API must specify which admission they are entering.

    "content": "A membership must have a valid time period that defines when it is active. This period ensures that members are only able to use their membership benefits during specific times. Various actions can manipulate these time periods:
Renewals: A renewal adds additional time after the current period, ensuring the membership continues without interruption once the current period ends.

Upgrades: An upgrade does not alter the time period but modifies the membership’s benefits by transitioning it to a higher or lower tier. The current period is terminated, but the overall duration remains the same.

Extensions: An extension creates a new period starting from today, terminating the current period early and ensuring the new period is longer than the original. This action increases the overall membership duration.


These time period adjustments allow memberships to evolve over time, adapting to the changing needs of the member or the organization, while maintaining clarity over when a membership is valid and usable.",

    "content": "The catalog endpoints serve as the foundation for a headless setup, offering a centralized way to access essential information about the available types of memberships.
Key Concepts:
Store Code Parameter:
The store code acts as a filter, allowing the system to tailor the available ticket information to a specific
sales channel or store front. Each store or sales channel may have its own unique set of memberships
and the store code ensures that only the relevant subset of catalog items are returned.
This is particularly useful in cases where different platforms, regions, or partners require distinct offerings.

Localized Storefront:
The store front is typically designed to target a specific language or region.
As a result, the catalog endpoint ensures that ticket information is delivered in the appropriate language for
the store's target audience. By supporting multiple languages, the system can accommodate global users
while ensuring that the presentation and messaging are localized.

Formatted Content Fields:
The catalog also supports two fields that can include HTML styling and formatting.
These fields provide flexibility for content presentation, allowing rich text formatting such as bold text,
lists, links, or other HTML elements.
This ensures that the ticket descriptions or other important information can be presented in an
engaging and readable way, enhancing the user experience across different devices or platforms.
It also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions
without requiring separate design templates for each store.",
