interaction with its backend services.
This documentation provides an overview of our API, its architecture, authentication mechanisms, and best practices for usage.
Overview of the REST API
Our REST API is designed to facilitate efficient communication between external applications and the Business Central backend.
Although Business Central primarily offers an OData API with limited POST methods, NaviPartner leverages a reverse proxy architecture.
This setup exposes a comprehensive REST API to the public, which internally translates requests to the Business Central OData endpoints.
This approach allows us to provide a full-fledged RESTful experience, enabling developers to perform standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
in a manner consistent with REST principles.
Key Features

Full REST Capabilities: Despite Business Central's OData limitations, our API provides full CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD) operations.
Reverse Proxy Architecture: We utilize a sophisticated reverse proxy system to translate between REST and OData, ensuring you can work with familiar REST conventions.
Seamless Integration: Our API acts as a transparent layer, allowing you to interact with Business Central data and processes as if you were using a native REST API.
Enhanced Security: Authentication is handled directly against the Business Central instance, ensuring robust security measures are in place.
Rate Limiting: Be mindful of the rate limits set for the API to avoid throttling and ensure fair usage across all users.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling in your applications to gracefully manage API errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

How It Works

Client Request: Your application sends a standard REST API request to our endpoint.
Reverse Proxy: Our reverse proxy receives the request and translates it into the appropriate OData format.
Business Central Interaction: The translated request is sent to the Business Central OData endpoint.
Response Processing: The OData response is received, unwrapped, and converted back into a REST-friendly format.
Client Response: The REST-formatted response is sent back to your application.

This process happens seamlessly and quickly, providing you with the ease of use of a REST API while leveraging the power of Business Central's backend.

Our API uses a set of global path parameters that must be included in every request. These parameters help route your request to the correct Business Central instance, environment, and company. Understanding and correctly using these parameters is crucial for successful API interactions.
If you are a developer working against NaviPartner container environment called Crane, you should also see differences in Working with Crane section.
Required Parameters
Every API request must include the following three path parameters in the order specified:

saasguid
saasenv
company

1. saasguid (SaaS GUID)

Type: String (UUID format)
Description: A unique identifier for the Business Central tenant in the Software as a Service (SaaS) environment.
Purpose: This GUID ensures that your request is directed to the correct Business Central tenant.
Format: A standard UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), consisting of 32 hexadecimal digits displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12.
Example: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

2. saasenv (SaaS Environment)

Type: String
Description: Specifies which environment of the Business Central tenant you want to access.
Purpose: Business Central can have multiple environments for different purposes (e.g., production, testing, development). This parameter ensures your request goes to the intended environment.
Possible Values:

production: The live, operational environment
sandbox: A non-production environment for testing or development
Custom named environments (e.g., test-1, dev-2)


Example: production or sandbox-1

3. company

Type: String
Description: The name of the specific company within the chosen Business Central environment.
Purpose: Business Central environments can contain multiple companies, each representing a separate data set. This parameter directs your request to the correct company data.
Format: The exact name of the company as it appears in Business Central. It may contain spaces and special characters, which should be properly URL-encoded in the request.
Example: CRONUS%20International%20Ltd. (URL-encoded version of "CRONUS International Ltd.")

More information how to work with companies can be found here.
URL Structure
The general structure of the API URL including these parameters is:
https://api.navipartner.app/{saasguid}/{saasenv}/{company}/[endpoint]

Example
Here's an example of how these parameters might look in a full API request URL:
https://api.navipartner.app/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/production/CRONUS%20International%20Ltd./configurations

In this example:

saasguid is 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
saasenv is production
company is CRONUS International Ltd. (URL-encoded in the actual request)
The specific endpoint being accessed is configurations

Important Notes


Order Matters: Always provide these parameters in the order specified: saasguid, then saasenv, then company.


URL Encoding: Ensure that the company name (and any other parameters that might contain spaces or special characters) are properly URL-encoded in your requests.


Case Sensitivity: The saasguid is typically case-insensitive, but saasenv and company may be case-sensitive depending on the specific Business Central setup. It's best to use the exact casing as provided by your Business Central administrator.


Obtaining Parameter Values: If you're unsure about the correct values for these parameters, contact your Business Central administrator or the person who provided you with API access.


Security: Treat the saasguid as sensitive information, as it's a key identifier for the Business Central tenant.


By correctly using these global path parameters, you ensure that your API requests are routed to the exact Business Central instance, environment, and company data set you intend to interact with.",

    "content": "Companies in Business Central
In Business Central, Companies serve as data envelopes, encapsulating all the data and business logic execution relevant to a specific organizational unit.
Each company operates as a separate environment within Business Central, with its own set of data tables.
This structure allows multiple companies to coexist within a single Business Central database (environment), while keeping their data isolated and secure.
How Companies Work in API Calls
When interacting with Business Central via REST API calls, it's crucial to specify the company in which the request should be executed.
The company is typically identified by a path segment in the API call, ensuring that the operation is performed within the correct data context.
For example, if you want to retrieve customers from a specific company, the API call must include the appropriate company identifier in the path.
REST API Feature: Companies Endpoint
Our REST API provides a convenient endpoint called Companies that allows clients to retrieve a list of all available companies within the Business Central database.
This feature is particularly useful for all applications that need to be aware of the companies they can interact with.
GET /companies
The companies endpoint responds to GET requests with a list of companies. Here's what the request looks like:
GET https://api.navipartner.app/tenant-id/environment-name/companies

This endpoint is an exception in terms of routing, as it does not use the global path segment named company.
Response
The response from the Companies endpoint will look like this:
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "17ff1351-d07d-4b85-8957-b4b585f47aad",
      "systemVersion": "24.0.16410.18056",
      "name": "CRONUS International Ltd.",
      "displayName": ""
    },
    {
      "id": "872336d7-5183-4c0b-9b47-755f3d6d77e7",
      "systemVersion": "24.0.16410.18056",
      "name": "TestCompany",
      "displayName": "TestCompany"
    }
  ]
}


name: The system name of the company. This holds the value that is relevant for all API calls.
displayName: The display name of the company (if different from the internal name, can be eventually empty).

Using the Company Information
Once the client application retrieves the list of companies, it can use one of the returned company names to make subsequent API calls.
This ensures that all operations are correctly targeted at the appropriate company, maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the application's business logic operates in the correct context.",

certain fields support HTML formatting for enhanced presentation of ticket details.
Capacity: Availability and Time Slots
The capacity API handles the availability of tickets for specific admissions at defined times.
Admissions represent the areas or events a ticket allows access to and are identified by unique codes.
To be valid, a ticket must be linked to a time slot that defines when it can be used.
Even sold-out or non-allocatable time slots are shown to indicate popularity and scarcity.
Dynamic pricing allows for time slots to have variable prices based on demand.
Reservations: The Reservation Lifecycle
The ticket reservation system manages the entire lifecycle of a ticket, from initial creation to confirmation,
cancellation, and validation. When a reservation is made, the system returns a token that can be used to
retrieve details and perform further actions like updates or cancellations.
This token expires after a set period, and tickets are not valid until confirmed.
The item number is a key identifier that represents the type of product being sold (i.e., the ticket)
and is used to determine its base price from a general price list.

The catalog endpoints serve as the foundation for a headless setup, offering a centralized way to access essential information 
about the available tickets. 

Key Concepts:

    * Store Code Parameter:
        The store code acts as a filter, allowing the system to tailor the available ticket information to a specific 
        sales channel or store front. Each store or sales channel may have its own unique set of tickets
        and the store code ensures that only the relevant subset of tickets is returned. 
        This is particularly useful in cases where different platforms, regions, or partners require distinct offerings.

    * Localized Storefront:
        The store front is typically designed to target a specific language or region. 
        As a result, the catalog endpoint ensures that ticket information is delivered in the appropriate language for 
        the store's target audience. By supporting multiple languages, the system can accommodate global users 
        while ensuring that the presentation and messaging are localized.

    * Formatted Content Fields:
        The catalog also supports two fields that can include HTML styling and formatting. 
        These fields provide flexibility for content presentation, allowing rich text formatting such as bold text, 
        lists, links, or other HTML elements. 
        This ensures that the ticket descriptions or other important information can be presented in an 
        engaging and readable way, enhancing the user experience across different devices or platforms. 
        It also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions 
        without requiring separate design templates for each store.",

It also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions
without requiring separate design templates for each store.

</Aside>

The capacity API is responsible for managing the availability of access to a specific admission at a designated time, 
ensuring the system can allocate resources for a ticket reservation.

Key Concepts:
    * Item Number: 
        This represents the product being sold at a high level. 
        Each item number corresponds to a category or type of ticket, and the base price is associated with 
        the item number. The base price is drawn from a general price list that applies across all similar items.

    * Admissions: 
        Admissions define the specific areas or events a ticket grants access to. 
        Each admission has a unique admission code, along with descriptive information and various predefined limits, 
        such as capacity or entry restrictions. These limits and policies can be set at different hierarchical levels, 
        allowing flexibility in how capacity is controlled.

    * Time-Based Validity: 
        In addition to defining what a ticket allows access to, the admission must also specify when the access is valid. 
        Every admission needs to be linked to a specific time slot to ensure proper scheduling. 
        In cases where the time is not explicitly provided, the system may assign a time slot automatically (defined by setup), 
        which is particularly useful for scenarios like walk-up ticket sales at kiosks, 
        where tickets should be valid immediately upon purchase.

    * Dynamic Pricing: 
        Each time slot can independently manage its pricing. 
        While the base price is determined by the item number, time slots can either use a fixed price or 
        apply dynamic pricing adjustments to the base price based on demand, capacity, or other factors.

    * Time Slot Visibility: All available time slots are displayed to the consumer, even if they are no longer 
        allocatable (e.g., fully booked or sold out). This is intentional, as it allows the system to provide 
        visibility into popular events, offering a sense of urgency or exclusivity that can drive consumer interest.",

Key Concepts

Reservation Token: A unique identifier assigned to each reservation. This token is used in most operations to reference a specific reservation.
Reservation States: A reservation can be in different states, such as:

"registered" (initially created)
"confirmed" (finalized)
"cancelled"
"expired"


Expiration: Reservations have a limited lifespan to prevent indefinite holds on tickets. Cancelled and Expired reservation will be purged from the system.
Item Numbers: These represent specific products or ticket types in the system.
Admission Codes and Schedule IDs: These are used to specify particular admissions and time slots for reservations.

Each entity has a specific role within the system, and they are interrelated in a way that accommodates a wide range of use cases, such as family memberships, guardianship, and individual access management.
Membership
A membership represents a defined relationship between an individual or a group of individuals (members) and an organization or service. Each membership can have one or more members, and it includes important information such as the type of membership, its associated benefits, and most importantly, a validity period that defines when the membership is active. A membership may also include complex structures like family memberships where multiple individuals (e.g., parents and children) are grouped together under the same membership umbrella.
The validity of a membership is tied to time periods, which dictate when the membership is active. Time periods can be manipulated through actions like renewals (adding time after the current period), upgrades (changing the benefits while maintaining the same time frame), and extensions (terminating the current period early and starting a new one from today). These actions ensure that memberships are flexible and can adapt to different needs and life situations.
Member
A member is an individual associated with one or more memberships. In many cases, a member will have a single membership, but they can hold multiple memberships concurrently, especially in scenarios like family memberships or guardianship relationships. For example, a parent may hold their own individual membership but also be a guardian on their child's membership, where they can manage and oversee the child's membership.
The member entity is primarily focused on the person—their personal details, contact information, and their association with one or more memberships. The ability to link members to multiple memberships allows for flexibility in managing groups or families where a person may need to oversee or participate in different memberships simultaneously.
Card
A card is a physical or virtual representation of a member’s access to their membership. Each member can have zero or more cards, and the cards are tied to specific memberships. Cards are primarily used to authenticate the member's access to services associated with the membership, such as gaining entry to a facility, participating in an event or getting membership benefits such as discounts.
A card is linked to a specific member and a specific membership, providing a bridge between the person and their ability to interact with the membership benefits. Cards can be added, replaced, or removed as needed, and in cases where a card is lost or damaged, it can be replaced with a new one while blocking the old one. Not all members may have cards (for example, in cases where physical access is not required), but the option to assign cards provides flexibility in how memberships are managed.
Time Periods and Membership Lifecycle Actions
A membership must have a valid time period that defines when it is active. This period ensures that members are only able to use their membership benefits during specific times. Various actions can manipulate these time periods:


Renewals: A renewal adds additional time after the current period, ensuring the membership continues without interruption once the current period ends.


Upgrades: An upgrade does not alter the time period but modifies the membership’s benefits by transitioning it to a higher or lower tier. The current period is terminated, but the overall duration remains the same.


Extensions: An extension creates a new period starting from today, terminating the current period early and ensuring the new period is longer than the original. This action increases the overall membership duration.


These time period adjustments allow memberships to evolve over time, adapting to the changing needs of the member or the organization, while maintaining clarity over when a membership is valid and usable.",

Upgrades: An upgrade does not alter the time period but modifies the membership’s benefits by transitioning it to a higher or lower tier. The current period is terminated, but the overall duration remains the same.


Extensions: An extension creates a new period starting from today, terminating the current period early and ensuring the new period is longer than the original. This action increases the overall membership duration.

    "description": "The catalog endpoints serve as the foundation for a headless setup, offering a centralized way to access essential information about the available types of memberships. 

Key Concepts:

    * Store Code Parameter:
        The store code acts as a filter, allowing the system to tailor the available ticket information to a specific 
        sales channel or store front. Each store or sales channel may have its own unique set of memberships
        and the store code ensures that only the relevant subset of catalog items are returned. 
        This is particularly useful in cases where different platforms, regions, or partners require distinct offerings.

    * Localized Storefront:
        The store front is typically designed to target a specific language or region. 
        As a result, the catalog endpoint ensures that ticket information is delivered in the appropriate language for 
        the store's target audience. By supporting multiple languages, the system can accommodate global users 
        while ensuring that the presentation and messaging are localized.

    * Formatted Content Fields:
        The catalog also supports two fields that can include HTML styling and formatting. 
        These fields provide flexibility for content presentation, allowing rich text formatting such as bold text, 
        lists, links, or other HTML elements. 
        This ensures that the ticket descriptions or other important information can be presented in an 
        engaging and readable way, enhancing the user experience across different devices or platforms. 
        It also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions 
        without requiring separate design templates for each store.",

Membership History
This endpoint provides a detailed view of the membership's past, capturing important milestones like creation, renewals, upgrades, downgrades, suspensions, and cancellations. It is useful for auditing and understanding the entire journey of the membership, from initiation to the current state.
Renew
The renew endpoint extends the membership beyond its current expiration date, adding additional time after the current period ends. This keeps the membership alive and ensures continuity for the member without any gaps in service.
Upgrade
The upgrade endpoint allows for the membership to be transitioned to a higher or lower plan or tier. This changes the benefits or features associated with the membership but does not affect the overall membership duration. The focus here is on enhancing the membership while keeping the time period intact.
Extend
The extend endpoint is used to modify the membership's time period by immediately terminating the current period and starting a new period from today. Unlike renewals, this results in an overall membership duration that is greater than before.",

This is typically used in scenarios where a member's access needs to be temporarily or permanently disabled. **Family Membership Downgrade** For family or group memberships, when the allowed number of valid members decreases (e.g., before a downgrade to a smaller membership plan), this endpoint can be used to block excess members to comply with the new membership limitations.
## RequestHeaders

- x-api-version=type_global-api-types:ApiVersionDate: date The x-api-version header is to specify which version of the API a client wants to interact with. This allows the server to provide different responses or behaviors based on the version provided. Version is a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". When not specified, the latest version is assumed.? 
## Path Parameters

- /
- saasguid
- /
- saasenv
- /
- company
- /memberships
- /member/
- memberId
- /block
## Response

### Body

type_memberships/service-member:BlockMemberResponse: cacheInstanceId=type_memberships/types/types-simple:CacheInstanceId: unknown Identifier for the NST instance. Providing this value will increase the performance of the API when the NST is load-balanced.? 
member=type_memberships/types/types-composite:MemberEntityResponse: memberId=unknown 
memberNumber=unknown 
blocked=unknown  The MemberEntityResponse extends the MemberEntityRequest and includes additional properties such as the member's ID, membership number, and blocked status. This DTO is used when returning a member's details.  : ",
