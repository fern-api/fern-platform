    "content": "Humanloop enables AI and product teams to develop LLM-based applications that are reliable and scalable.
Principally, it is an evaluation framework that enables you to rigorously measure and improve LLM performance during development and in production and a collaborative workspace where engineers, PMs and subject matter experts improve prompts, tools and agents together.
By adopting Humanloop, teams save 6-8 engineering hours per project each week and they feel confident that their AI is reliable.






The power of Humanloop lies in its integrated approach to AI development. Evaluation,
monitoring and prompt engineering in one integrated platform enables you to understand system performance and take the actions needed to fix it.
The SDK slots seamlessly into your existing code-based orchestration and the user-friendly interface allows both developers and non-technical stakeholders to adjust the AI together.
You can learn more about the challenges of AI development and how Humanloop solves them in Why Humanloop?.",

    "content": "The principal way you "program" LLMs is through natural language instructions called prompts. There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.
Developing, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:
Subject matter experts matter more than ever. As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.

AI output is often non-deterministic. Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.

AI outputs are subjective. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.




Bad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch
Many companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and engineers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets. The process is slow and error-prone, wasting engineering time and leading to long delays and feelings of uncertainty.",

A Prompt is callable in that if you supply the necessary inputs, it will return a response from the model.
Inputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. {{topic}} and the value of the variable will need to be supplied when you call the Prompt to create a generation.
This separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different configurations and evaluate any changes.
The Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data in Logs, which can then be used to create Datasets for evaluation purposes.


Note that we use a capitalized "Prompt" to refer to
the entity in Humanloop, and a lowercase "prompt" to refer to the general
concept of input to the model.",

Messages: for chat models, as well as the prompt template, you can optionally have a history of chat messages that are fed into amodel when generating a response.

Target: certain types of test cases can benefit from comparing the out your application to an expected or desired behaviour. In the simplest case, this can simply be a string representing the exact output you hope the model produces for the inputs and messages represented by the Datapoint.
In more complex cases, you can define an arbitrary JSON object for target with whatever fields are necessary to help you specify the intended behaviour.",

You are using your own model that is not natively supported in the Humanloop runtime.

The prompt.call() Api encapsulates the LLM provider calls (for example openai.Completions.create()), the model-config selection and logging steps in a single unified interface.

Click the "+ Message" button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.


Add the following templated message to the chat template.
This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called topic (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.

Create the Prompt


Go to the App
Go to the Humanloop app and you will see your new project as a Prompt with the model config you just created.
You now have a Prompt in Humanloop that contains your initial version. You can call the Prompt in Editor and invite team members by going to your organization's members page.",

consistent interface across different AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and more – see the full list of supported models

    "content": "To create and use a tool follow the following steps:


Open the editor
Go to a Prompt and open the Editor.
Select a model that supports Tool Calling


To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models
page.
In the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose a model like gpt-4o which supports Tool Calling.
Define the Tool
To get started with tool definition, it's recommended to begin with one of our preloaded example tools. For this guide, we'll use the get_current_weather tool. Select this from the dropdown menu of preloaded examples.
If you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax. When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.


Test it out
Now, let's test our tool by inputting a relevant query. Since we're working with a weather-related tool, try typing: What's the weather in Boston?. This should prompt OpenAI to respond using the parameters we've defined.


Keep in mind that the model's use of the tool depends on the relevance of the user's input. For instance, a question like 'how are you today?' is unlikely to trigger a weather-related tool response.
Check assistant response for a tool call
Upon successful setup, the assistant should respond by invoking the tool, providing both the tool's name and the required data. For our get_current_weather tool, the response might look like this:
Input tool response
After the tool call, the editor will automatically add a partially filled tool message for you to complete.
You can paste in the exact response that the Tool would respond with. For prototyping purposes, you can also just simulate the repsonse yourself (LLMs can handle it!). Provide in a mock response:
To input the tool response:
Find the tool response field in the editor.

Enter theresponse matching the expected format, such as:


Remember, the goal is to simulate the tool's output as if it were actually fetching real-time weather data. This allows you to test and refine your prompt and tool interaction without needing to implement the actual weather API.
Submit tool response
After entering the simulated tool response, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to the AI model.
Review assistant response
The assistant should now respond using the information provided in your simulated tool response. For example, if you input that the weather in London was drizzling at 12°C, the assistant might say:
Based on the current weather data, it's drizzling in London with a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius.
This response demonstrates how the AI model incorporates the tool's output into its reply, providing a more contextual and data-driven answer.


Iterate and refine
Feel free to experiment with different queries and simulated tool responses. This iterative process helps you fine-tune your prompt and understand how the AI model interacts with the tool, ultimately leading to more effective and accurate responses in your application.
Save your Prompt
By saving your prompt, you're creating a new version that includes the tool configuration.
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use tool calling in the Humanloop editor. This powerful feature allows you to simulate and test tool interactions, helping you create more dynamic and context-aware AI applications.
Keep experimenting with different scenarios and tool responses to fully explore the capabilities of your AI model and create even more impressive applications!",

To create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:


Create a new Snippet Tool


Name the Tool
Name it assistant-personalities and give it a description Useful assistant personalities.
Add a key called "helpful-assistant"
In the initial box add helpful-assistant and give it a value of You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.
Add another key called "grumpy-assistant"
Let's add another key-value pair, so press the Add a key/value pair button and add a new key of grumpy-assistant and give it a value of You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy..


Press Create Tool.
Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.
Navigate to the Editor
Go to the Editor of your previously created project.
Add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt
Delete the existing prompt template and add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt.


Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. {{ my-tool-name(key) }}.
Enter the key as an input
In the input area set the value to helpful-assistant. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your key.
Press the Run button
Start the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.


Change the key to grumpy-assistant.


If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to
first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
Play with the LLM
Ask the LLM, I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'. You should see a grumpy response from "Freddy" now.
If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant-personalities("grumpy-assistant") }}. Delete the grumpy-assistant field and add it into your chat template.
Save your Prompt.
If you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.


The Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the Prompts when you update them, as long as the key is the same.


Since the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing
the values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools can affect the Prompt's
behaviour in way that won't be captured by the Prompt's version.
This could be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the
changes are expected.",

Create a new Tool file
Navigate to the homepage or sidebar and click the 'New File' button.
Choose the JSON Schema Tool type
From the available options, select Json Schema as the Tool type.
Define your tool's structure
Paste the following JSON into the provided dialog to define your tool's structure:
If you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax. When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.
Commit this version of the Tool
Press the Commit button to commit this version of the Tool, and set it as the default version by deploying it.
Navigate to the Editor of a Prompt
Switch to a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.


To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models
page.
Add Tool to the Prompt definition.
Select 'Link existing Tool'
In the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option. You should see your get_current_weather tool, click on it to link it to your editor.


Test that the Prompt is working with the tool
Now that your Tool is linked you can start using it. In the Chat section, in the User input, enter "what is the weather in london?"
Press the Run button.
You should see the Assistant respond with the tool response and a new Tool field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in 22 into the tool response and press Run.


The model will respond with The current weather in London is 22 degrees.
Commit the Prompt
You've linked a Tool to your Prompt, now let's save it. Press the Save button and name your Prompt weather-model-config.
(Optional) Update the Tool
Now that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your Prompt, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tool in the sidebar and go to the Editor.
Update the Tool
Let's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:
Commit and deploy the Tool
Press the Commmmit button and then follow the steps to deloy this version of the Tool.
Your Tool is now updated.
Try the Prompt again
Navigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.
In the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.
Check the response
You should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your Prompt.




When updating your Tool, remember that the change will affect all the Prompts
that link to it. Be careful when making updates to not inadvertently change
something you didn't intend.",

Create a Tool file
Click the 'New File' button on the homepage or in the sidebar.
Select the Json Schema Tool type
Define your tool
Set the name, description, and parameters values. Our guide for using Tool Calling in the Prompt Editor can be a useful reference in this case. We can use the get_current_weather schema in this case. Paste the following into the dialog:
Press the Create button.
Navigate to the Editor
Make sure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.


See the Models page for a list of models that support tool calling.
Add Tool to the Prompt definition.
Select 'Link existing Tool'
In the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option. You should see your get_current_weather tool, click on it to link it to your editor.


Test that the Prompt is working with the tool
Now that your tool is linked you can start using it as you would normally use an inline tool. In the Chat section, in the User input, enter "What is the weather in london?"
Press the Run button.
You should see the Assistant respond with the tool response and a new Tool field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in 22 into the tool response and press Run.


The model will respond with The current weather in London is 22 degrees.
Save the Prompt
You've linked a tool to your model config, now let's save it. Press the Save button and name your model config weather-model-config.
(Optional) Update the Tool
Now that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your model config, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tools in the sidebar and go to the Editor.
Change the tool.
Let's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:
Save the Tool
Press the Save button, then the following Continue button to confirm.
Your tool is now updated.
Try the Prompt again
Navigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.
In the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.
Check the response
You should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your model config.




When updating your organization-level JSON Schema tools, remember that the
change will affect all the places you've previously linked the tool. Be
careful when making updates to not inadvertently change something you didn't
intend.",

You should have an existing Prompt on Humanloop and already generated some Logs.
Follow our guide on creating a Prompt.
Steps
To create a Dataset from existing Logs:


Navigate to the Logs of your Prompt
Our Prompt in this example is a Support Agent that answers user queries about Humanloop's product and docs:


Select a subset of the Logs to add
Filter logs on a criteria of interest, such as the version of the Prompt used, then multi-select Logs.
In the menu in the top right of the page, select Add to dataset.


Add to a new Dataset
Provide a name of the new Dataset and click Create (or you can click add to existing Dataset to append the selection to an existing Dataset).
Then provide a suitable commit message describing the datapoints you've added.


You will then see the new Dataset appear at the same level in the filesystem as your Prompt.",

You should have an existing Prompt on Humanloop with a variable defined with our double curly bracket syntax {{variable}}. If not, first follow our guide on creating a Prompt.
In this example, we'll use a Prompt that categorises user queries about Humanloop's product and docs by which feature they relate to.


Steps
To create a dataset from a CSV file, we'll first create a CSV in Google Sheets that contains values for our Prompt variable {{query}} and then upload it to a Dataset on Humanloop.


Create a CSV file.
In our Google Sheets example below, we have a column called query which contains possible values for our Prompt variable {{query}}. You can include as many columns as you have variables in your Prompt template.

There is additionally a column called target which will populate the target output for the classifier Prompt. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.

More complex Datapoints that contain messages and structured objects for targets are suppoerted, but are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be hard-to-read JSON. If you need more complex Datapoints, use the API instead.




Export the Google Sheet to CSV
In Google sheets, choose File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)
Create a new Dataset File
On Humanloop, select New at the bottom of the left hand sidebar, then select Dataset.


Click Upload CSV
First name your dataset when prompted in the sidebar, then select the Upload CSV button and drag and drop the CSV file you created above using the file explorer.
You will then be prompted to provide a commit message to describe the initial state of the dataset.


Follow the link in the pop-up to inspect the Dataset created
You'll see the input-output pairs that were included in the CSV file and you can the rows to inspect and edit the individual Datapoints.",

Steps
Using the API is a great way to integrate Humanloop with your existing data pipeline or just to once-off upload a more complex Dataset that is hard to represent in a CSV file, such as one that contains an array of messages and JSON targets.


Post data to the Datasets API
We first define some sample data that contains user messages and desired responses from our Support Agent Prompt and call the POST /datasets endpoint to upload it as follows:

Define the Evaluator code
After creating the Evaluator, you will automatically be taken to the code editor.
For this example, our Evaluator will check that the feature category returned by the Prompt is from the list of allowed feature categories. We want to ensure our categoriser isn't hallucinating new features.
Make sure the Mode of the Evaluator is set to Online in the options on the left.

Copy and paste the following code into the code editor:




You can define multiple functions in the code Editor to organize your
evaluation logic. The final function defined is used as the main Evaluator
entry point that takes the Log argument and returns a valid judgement.
Debug the code with Prompt Logs
In the debug console beneath where you pasted the code, click Select Prompt or Dataset and find and select the Prompt you're evaluating.
The debug console will load a sample of Logs from that Prompt.




Click the Run button at the far right of one of the loaded Logs to trigger a debug run. This causes the code to be executed with the selected Log as input and populates the Result column.

Inspect the output of the executed code by selecting the arrow to the right of Result.

Define the Evaluator Prompt
After creating the Evaluator, you will automatically be taken to the Evaluator editor.
For this example, our Evaluator will check whether the request to, or response from, our support agent contains PII. We want to understand whether this is a potential issue that we wish to mitigate with additional Guardrails in our agent workflow.
Make sure the Mode of the Evaluator is set to Online in the options on the left.

Copy and paste the following Prompt into the Editor:




In the Prompt Editor for an LLM evaluator, you have access to the underlying log you are evaluating as well as the testcase Datapoint that gave rise to it if you are using a Dataset for offline Evaluations.
These are accessed with the standard {{ variable }} syntax, enhanced with a familiar dot notation to pick out specific values from inside the log and testcase objects.
For example, suppose you are evaluating a Log object like this.
In the LLM Evaluator Prompt, {{ log.inputs.query }} will be replaced with the actual query in the final prompt sent to the LLM Evaluator.
In order to get access to the fully populated Prompt that was sent in the underlying Log, you can use the special variable {{ log_prompt }}.
Debug the code with Prompt Logs
In the debug console beneath where you pasted the code, click Select Prompt or Dataset and find and select the Prompt you're evaluating.

An Evaluation on Humanloop leverages a Dataset, a set of Evaluators and different versions of a Prompt to compare.
The Dataset contains testcases describing the inputs (and optionally the expected results) for a given task. The Evaluators define the criteria for judging the performance of the Prompts when executed using these inputs.
Each of the Prompt versions you want to compare are run against the same Dataset producing Logs; judgements are then provided by Evaluators.
The Evaluation then uses these judgements to provide a summary report of the performance allowing you to systematically compare the performance of the different Prompt versions.",

You can combine multiple different types of Evaluator in a single Evaluation.
For example, you might use an AI Evaluator to judge the quality of the output
of the Prompt and a code Evaluator to check the output is below some latency
and cost threshold.
For this example, we're going to evaluate the performance of a Support Agent that responds to user queries about Humanloop's product and documentation.

Navigate to the Evaluations tab of your Prompt
On the left-hand sidebar, click on the Evaluations tab beneath your Prompt.

Click the Evaluate button top right, which presents the setup panel for the Evaluation.




Setup the Evaluation
Select a Dataset using +Dataset.

Add the Prompt versions you want to compare using +Version - note you can multi-select versions in the modal resulting in multiple columns.

Add the Evaluators you want to use to judge the performance of the Prompts using +Evaluator. By default, Cost, Tokens and Latency Evaluators are pre-selected.




By default the system will re-use Logs if they exist for the chosen Dataset, Prompts and Evaluators. This makes it easy to extend reports without paying the cost of re-running your Prompts and Evaluators.
If you want to force the system to re-run the Prompts against the Dataset producing a new batch of Logs, you can select the Manage button in the setup panel and choose +New Batch.
Select Save to trigger the Evaluation report. You will see the report below the setup panel populate with a progress bar and status pending as the Logs are generated on Humanloop.






This guide assumes both the Prompt and Evaluator Logs are generated using the
Humanloop runtime. For certain use cases where more flexibility is required,
the runtime for producing Logs instead lives in your code - see our guide on
Logging, which also works with our
Evaluations feature. We have a guide for how to run Evaluations with Logs
generated in your code coming soon!
Review the results
It will generally take at least a couple of minutes before the Evaluation report is marked as completed as the system generates all the required Prompt and Evaluator Logs.
Once the report is completed, you can review the performance of the different Prompt versions using the Evaluators you selected.
The top spider plot provides you with a summary of the average Evaluator performance across all the Prompt versions.
In our case, gpt-4o, although on average slightly slower and more expensive on average, is significantly better when it comes to User Satisfaction.




Below the spider plot, you can see the breakdown of performance per Evaluator.




To drill into and debug the Logs that were generated, select the Logs button top right of the Evaluation report.
This brings you to the Evaluation Logs table and you can filter and review logs to understand the performance better and replay Logs in our Prompt Editor.",

Apply judgments to generated Logs
When you save an Evaluation, Humanloop will automatically generate Logs using the specified Prompt versions and Dataset.
When the required Logs are generated, a "Human Evaluations incomplete" message will be displayed in a toolbar at the top of the Evaluation.
Go to the Logs tab of the Evaluation to view the generated Logs.


Evaluation Logs tab
Expand the drawer for a Log by clicking on the row to view the Log details. Here, you can view the generated output and apply judgments to the Log.

Code based - Using our in-browser editor, define simple Python functions to act as evaluators. These run automatically on your logs.

LLM as judge - Use LLMs to evaluate the outputs of other Prompts or Tools. Our editor lets you create prompts that pass log data to a model for assessment. This is ideal for subjective evaluations like tone and factual accuracy. These also run automatically.

Human evaluators - Collect feedback from human evaluators using our feedback API. This allows you to incorporate human judgment or in-app actions into your monitoring process.

Create a Slack incoming webhook
Go to your Slack workspace and create a new Slack app (or use an existing one).

Under "Add features and functionality", choose "Incoming Webhooks" and activate them.

Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace" and choose the channel where you want to receive notifications.

Copy the webhook URL provided by Slack.


Import the Humanloop SDK and initialize the client
Replace "your-api-key" with your actual Humanloop API key.
Create a webhook
Replace the following:
"https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK" with your Slack webhook URL

"your-model-name" with the name of the model you want to monitor

"your-shared-secret" with a secret string of your choice for added security


Test the webhook
To test if your webhook is working correctly, you can trigger an evaluation:

    "content": "This guide shows how to use the Humanloop SDK to record end-user feedback on Logs.


Different use-cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user interaction.
There are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:
Explicit feedback: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.

Implicit feedback: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).

Free-form feedback: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.


You should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.
For example, a Human Evaluator with return type "text" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type "multi_select" can be used to capture user actions
that provide implicit feedback.
If you have not done so, you can follow our guide to create a Human Evaluator to set up the appropriate feedback schema.",

The "correction" Evaluator can be used to record user-provided corrections to the generations (e.g. If the user edits the generation before copying it).

We've added a new key building block to our app with the first release of Flows. This release focuses on improving the code-first workflows for evaluating more complex AI applications like RAG and Agent-based apps.
Flows allow you to version your whole AI application on Humanloop (as opposed to just individual Prompts and Tools) and allows you to log and evaluate the full trace of the important processing steps that occur when running your app.
See our cookbook tutorial for examples on how to use Flows in your code.

What's next
We'll soon be extending support for allowing Evaluators to access all Logs inside a trace.
Additionally, we will build on this by adding UI-first visualisations and management of your Flows.
We'll sunset Sessions in favour of Flows in the near future. Reach out to us for guidance on how to migrate your Session-based workflows to Flows.",

    "content": "Human Evaluator upgrades
We've made significant upgrades to Human Evaluators and related workflows to improve your ability to gather Human judgments (sometimes referred to as "feedback") in assessing the quality of your AI applications.
Here are some of the key improvements:
Instead of having to define a limited feedback schema tied to the settings of a specific Prompt, you can now define your schema with a Human Evaluator file and reuse it across multiple Prompts and Tools for both monitoring and offline evaluation purposes.

You are no longer restricted to the default types of Rating, Actions and Issues when defining your feedback schemas from the UI. We've introduced a more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types and valence controls.

We've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now also be used with Tools and other Evaluators (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.

We've improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.


To set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on Evaluator, then click on Human.
This will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a Return type for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.
Tone evaluator set up with options and instructions
You can then reference this Human Evaluator within the Monitoring dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their Evaluations tab.
We've set up default Rating and Correction Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing. We've migrated all your existing Prompt specific feedback schemas to Human Evaluator files and these will continue to work as before with no disruption.
Check out our updated document for further details on how to use Human Evaluators:

We've given the Log drawer's Evaluation tab a facelift. You can now clearly see what the results are for each of the connected Evaluators.
This means that it's now easier to debug the judgments applied to a Log, and if necessary, re-run code/AI Evaluators in-line.

Ability to re-run Evaluators
We have introduced the ability to re-run your Evaluators against a specific Log. This feature allows you to more easily address and fix issues with previous Evaluator judgments for specific Logs.
You can request a re-run of that Evaluator by opening the menu next to that Evaluator and pressing the "Run Again" option.

OpenAI have introduced Structured Outputs functionality to their API.
This feature allows the model to more reliably adhere to user defined JSON schemas for use cases like information extraction, data validation, and more.
We've extended our /chat (in v4) and prompt/call (in v5) endpoints to support this feature. There are two ways to trigger Structured Outputs in the API:
Tool Calling: When defining a tool as part of your Prompt definition, you can now include a strict=true flag. The model will then output JSON data that adheres to the tool parameters schema definition.


Response Format: We have expanded the response_format with option json_schema and a request parameter to also include an optional json_schema field where you can pass in the schema you wish the model to adhere to.


This new response formant functionality is only supported by the latest OpenAPI model snapshots gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.
We will also be exposing this functionality in our Editor UI soon too!",

    "content": "Evaluation Comparison Reports
We've released Evaluation reports, which allows you to easily compare the performance of your different Prompts or Tools across multiple different Evaluator criteria.
This generalises our previous concept of Evaluation runs, extending it with multiple complimentary changes with getting more from your evals. All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.


Feature breakdown
We've introduced a new stats comparison view, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.
The performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.
Evaluation reports also introduce an automatic deduplication feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a New Batch in the setup panel.


How to use Evaluation reports
To get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click Evaluate in the top right.
This will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.

When you click Save, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.
What's next
We're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations.",

It also means you get the full power of our file versioning system, allowing you track and commit every change you make Datasets and their Datapoints, with attribution and commit messages inspired by Git.


It's now easy to understand which version of a Dataset was used in a given Evaluation run, and whether the most recent edits to the Dataset were included or not.

Introducing same day support for the Claude 3 - Anthropics new industry leading models. Read more about the release here.
The release contains three models in ascending order of capability: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. This suite provides users with the different options to balance intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific use-cases.


Key take aways
Performance - a new leader. The largest of the 3 models, Opus, is claimed to outperform GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on key benchmarks such as MMLU and Hellaswag. It even reached 84.9% on the Humaneval coding test set (vs GPT-4’s 67%) 🤯

200k context window with near-perfect recall on selected benchmarks. Opus reports 99% accuracy on the NIAH test, which measures how accurately a model can recall information given to it in a large corpus of data.

Opus has vision. Anthropic claim that performance here is on par with that of other leading models (ie GPT-4 and Gemini). They say it’s most useful for inputting graphs, slides etc. in an enterprise setting.

Pricing - as compared to OpenAI:


Opus - 75 (2.5x GPT-4 Turbo)  
Sonnet - 15 (50% of GPT-4 Turbo)

Haiku - $1.25 (1.6x GPT-3.5)

You can now create Tools in the same way as you create Prompts and Directories. This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.

To create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.
Tool editor and deployments
You can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.

Tool Editor
This replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.

Deployment
Tools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.
And example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature snippet(key) with a key/value pair of "helpful"/"You are a helpful assistant". You decide you would rather change the value to say "You are a funny assistant", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.

We've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.


The labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.
You'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.


As a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.


Committing Prompt Versions
Building on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.
This is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.
In addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use commits that can take commit messages, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.
We've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.


We'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.
Let us know if you have any questions around these changes!",

Datapoints are color-coded by the dataset used for the run.
The table is now paginated and does not load your entire project's list of evaluation runs in a single page load. The page should therefore load faster for teams with a large number of runs.

    "content": "Add Evaluators to existing runs
You can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.


Improved Evaluation Debug Console
We've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.

On any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.
After clicking Run to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.

LLM Evaluators
We expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.
After clicking Run on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the LLM Evaluation Log column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.

This is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.

Tool projects
We have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config in the Editor as well as tools managed at organization level.
It is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.

Tool versioning
In the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.
Logs
Any logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our sessions guide and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session
Offline Evaluations via SDK
You can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the Set up evaluations using API guide.
Support for new OpenAI Models
Following OpenAI's latest model releases, you will find support for all the latest models in our Playground and Editor.
GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo
If your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release gpt-4-0125-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.

We also support the new gpt-4-turbo-preview model alias, which points to the latest gpt-4-turbo model without specifying a specific version.
Embedding Models
Finally, the new embedding models - text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are also available for use via Humanloop. The small model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation ada-002 embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space.",

Cancellable evaluation runs
Occasionally, you may launch an evaluation run and then realise that you didn't configure it quite the way you wanted. Perhaps you want to use a different model config or dataset, or would like to halt its progress for some other reason.

We've started the year by enhancing our evaluations API to give you more flexibility for self-hosting whichever aspects of the evaluation workflow you need to run in your own infrastructure - while leaving the rest to us!
Mixing and matching the Humanloop-runtime with self-hosting
Conceptually, evaluation runs have two components:
Generation of logs for the datapoints using the version of the model you are evaluating.

Evaluating those logs using Evaluators.


Now, using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted (see our guide on external generations for evaluations).
Similarly, evaluating of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app), or self-hosted (see our guide on self-hosted evaluations).
It is now possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime logs and evaluations in any combination you wish.
When creating an Evaluation (via the improved UI dialogue or via the API), you can set the new hl_generated flag to False to indicate that you are posting the logs from your own infrastructure. You can then also include an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.


You can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators.",

We've introduced a new special type of 'Human' Evaluator to compliment our existing code and AI based Evaluators.
There are many important evaluation use cases that require input from your internal domain experts, or product teams. Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.


Our new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.
Once completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.


Set up your first Human Evaluator run by following our guide.
Return inputs flag
We've introduced a return_inputs flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.
As context model windows get increasingly larger, for example Claude with 200k tokens, it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.
When you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the inputs that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.
As always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.
Gemini
You can now use Google's latest LLMs, Gemini, in Humanloop.
Setup
To use Gemini, first go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey and generate an API key. Then, save this under the "Google" provider on your API keys page.
Head over to the playground, and you should see gemini-pro and gemini-pro-vision in your list of models.


You can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's /chatendpoints.
Features
Gemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.
However, note that while gemini-pro supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, gemini-pro-vision supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to Gemini's docs for more details.
When providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL.",

    "content": "Tool linking
It's now possible to manage tool definitions globally for your organization and re-use them across multiple projects by linking them to your model configs.
Prior to this change, if you wanted to re-use the same tool definition across multiple model configs, you had to copy and paste the JSON schema snippet defining the name, description and parameters into your Editor for each case. And if you wanted to make changes to this tool, you would have to recall which model configs it was saved to prior and update them inline 1 by 1.
You can achieve this tool re-use by first defining an instance of our new JsonSchema tool available as another option in your global Tools tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit'), and then link that to as many model configs as you need within the Editor as shown below.
Importantly, updates to the get_current_weather JsonSchema tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the model configs you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the prompt.
The old behaviour of defining the tool inline as part of your model config definition is still available for the cases where you do want changes in the definition of the tool to lead to new versions of the model-config.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the JsonSchema tool card.

With the dialog open, define your tool with name, description, and parameters values. Our guide for using OpenAI Function Calling in the playground can be a useful reference in this case.
Using the tool
In the editor of your target project, link the tool by pressing the Add Tool button and selecting your get_current_weather tool.",

We've updated how we show logs and datapoints in their respective tables. You can now see the stack of inputs and messages in a cleaner interface rather than having them spread into separate columns.


There will be more updates soon to improve how logs and prompts are shown in tables and the drawers soon, so if you have ideas for improvements please let us know.
Introducing .prompt files
We're introducing a .prompt file format for representing model configs in a format that's both human-readable and easy to work with.
For certain use cases it can be helpful for engineers to also store their prompts alongside their app's source code in their favourite version control system. The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.
These .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.
Exporting via API
To fetch a .prompt file via the API, make POST request to https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export, where {id} is the ID of the model config (beginning with config_).
Export from Humanloop
You can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click Export .prompt. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).


Editor
Additionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press Cmd-Shift-E when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.


More details on our .prompt file format are available here. We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned.",

    "content": "Improved RBACs
We've introduced more levels to our roles based access controls (RBACs).
We now distinguish between different roles to help you better manage your organization's access levels and permissions on Humanloop.
This is the first in a sequence of upgrades we are making around RBACs.
Organization roles
Everyone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).
A user can be one of the following rolws:
**Admin:**The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.
Developer:(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.
Member:(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.
RBACs summary
Here is the full breakdown of roles and access:
Action Member Developer Admin 
Create and manage Prompts ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Inspect logs and feedback ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage evaluators ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Run evaluations ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage datasets ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage API keys  ✔️ ✔️ 
Manage prompt deployments  ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage environments  ✔️ ✔️ 
Send invites   ✔️ 
Set user roles   ✔️ 
Manage billing   ✔️ 
Change organization settings   ✔️ 

Self hosted evaluations
We've added support for managing evaluations outside of Humanloop in your own code.
There are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.
For example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or LLM evaluator within your Humanloop project.
With this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.
To better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:
Retrieve your curated datasets

Trigger evaluation runs

Send evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators


Below is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our guide on self-hosted evaluations.
Chat response
We've updated the response models of all of our /chat API endpoints to include an output message object.
Up to this point, our chat and completion endpoints had a unified response model, where the content of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common output field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate tool_calls field.
When making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an output_message field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.
Before:
After:
Snippet tool
We've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.
This functionality is provided by our new Snippet tool. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.
For example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.
Before now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.

When the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.


You can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.
The name field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as assistant below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax {{ assistant(key) }}.
The key is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.
The value is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.

Use the tool
Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.

The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our editor environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.
Above we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the {{ <your-tool-name>(key) }} so in this case it would be {{ assistant(key) }}. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your key, in the screenshot above we used the helpful key to access the You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.


If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant("helpful") }}.

This is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.

We've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.
With the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as parallel tool calling.
Editor updates
You can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:
Select one of the new turbo models in the model dropdown.

Specify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.

Make a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.

As shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message




API implications
We've added an additional field tool_calls to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing tool_call parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.
Each element in the tool_calls array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the tool_call_id must be provided, along with role=tool and the content containing the tool response.
Python SDK improvements
We've improved the response models of our Python SDK and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.
Improved response model types
As of versions >= 0.6.0, our Python SDK methods now return Pydantic models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.
Previously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:


With Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from < 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the Raw HTTP Response section.


🚧 Breaking change
Moving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.

Support for timeout parameter
The default timeout used by aiohttp, which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.
In the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passingtimeout=1000 will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.
Multi-modal models
We've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!
We've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V). You can now select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.
Let us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!
Editor quick start
To get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.
Select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown.

Click the Add images button within a user's chat message.

To add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select "Upload image" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.

Note that you can add multiple images




To view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.


API quick start
Assuming you have deployed your gpt-4-vision-preview based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.
Any generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.
Limitations
There are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:
Image messages are only supported by the gpt-4-vision-preview model in chat mode.

GPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.

You cannot add images to the first system message.


JSON mode and seed parameters
We've introduced new model config parameters for JSON mode and Seed in our Editor and API.
With the introduction of the new OpenAI turbo models you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; response_format and seed.



See further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format here and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter here.
These new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for response_format or seed will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.




When using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.
In fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.",

    "content": "LLM Evaluators
Until now, it's been possible to trigger LLM-based evaluations by writing Python code that uses the Humanloop API to trigger the LLM generations.
Today, in order to make this increasingly important workflow simpler and more intuitive, we're releasing LLM Evaluators, which require no Python configuration.
From the Evaluations page, click New Evaluator and select LLM Evaluator.


Instead of a code editor, the right hand side of the page is now a prompt editor for defining instructions to the LLM Evaluator. Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.


In the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual {{ variable }} syntax, and include:
log_inputs - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated

log_prompt - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)

log_messages - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)

log_output - the output produced by the model

log_error - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced

testcase - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.


Take a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.


At the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.
Since an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.
Improved evaluator editor
Given our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.

In the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:
Select the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs

Select the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number


Underneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets.",

Multiple model configs
To run evaluations against multiple model configs it's as simple as selecting the targeted model configs in the run dialog, similar to before, but multiple choices are now supported. This will trigger multiple evaluation runs at once, with each model config selected as a target.

Evaluation table
We've updated our evaluation runs with a table to help view the outcomes of runs in a more condensed form. It also allows you to sort results and trigger re-runs easier. As new evaluators are included, a column will be added automatically to the table.

Re-run previous evaluations
We've exposed the re-run option in the table to allow you to quickly trigger runs again, or use older runs as a way to preload the dialog and change the parameters such as the target dataset or model config.

New OpenAI turbos
Off the back of OpenAI's dev day we've added support for the new turbo models that were announced:
gpt-4-1106-preview

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

If you've previously been using testsets in the evaluations beta, you'll see that your testsets have now automatically migrated to datasets.
Datasets can be created via CSV upload, converting from existing Logs in your project, or by API requests.
See our guides on datasets, which show how to upload from CSV and perform a batch generation across the whole dataset.


Clicking into a dataset, you can explore its datapoints.


A dataset contains a collection of prompt variable inputs (the dynamic values which are interpolated into your model config prompt template at generation-time), as well as a collection of messages forming the chat history, and a target output with data representing what we expect the model to produce when it runs on those inputs.
Datasets are useful for evaluating the behaviour of you model configs across a well-defined collection of test cases. You can use datasets to check for regressions as you iterate your model configs, knowing that you are checking behaviour against a deterministic collection of known important examples.
Datasets can also be used as collections of input data for fine-tuning jobs.",

This can be used to dynamically retrieve context for your prompts. For example, you may wish to get additional information about a user from your system based on their ID, or look up additional information based on a query from a user.
To set up the tool you need to provide the following details for your API:
Tool parameter Description Example 
Name A unique tool name to reference as a call signature in your prompts get_api_tool 
URL The URL for your API endpoint https://your-api.your-domain.com 
API Key Header The authentication header required by your endpoint. X-API-KEY 
API Key The API key value to use in the authentication header. sk_1234567891011121314 
Query parameters A comma delimited list of the query parameters to set when making requests. user_query, client_id 

Define your API
First you will need to define your API. For demo purposes, we will create a mock endpoint in postman. Our mock endpoint simply returns details about a mock user given their user_id.
A call to our Mock API in Python is as follows; note the query parameter user_id
And returns the response:
We can now use this tool to inject information for a given user into our prompts.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Get API Call  tool card:


Configure the tool with your API details:


Use the tool
Now your API tool is set up, you can use it to populate input variables in your prompt templates. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. The call signature is the unique tool name with arguments for the query parameters defined when the tool was set up.
In our mock example, the signature will be:  get_user_api(user_id).
An example prompt template using this tool is:
The tool requires an input value to be provided for user_id. In our playground environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat:

We're continuing to build and release more functionality to Humanloop's evaluations framework!
Our first release provided the ability to run online evaluators in your projects. Online evaluators allow you to monitor the performance of your live deployments by defining functions which evaluate all new datapoints in real time as they get logged to the project.
Today, to augment online evaluators, we are releasing offline evaluators as the second part of our evaluations framework.
Offline evaluators provide the ability to test your prompt engineering efforts rigorously in development and CI. Offline evaluators test the performance of your model configs against a pre-defined suite of testcases - much like unit testing in traditional programming.
With this framework, you can use test-driven development practices to iterate and improve your model configs, while monitoring for regressions in CI.
To learn more about how to use online and offline evaluators, check out the Evaluate your model section of our guides.",

    "content": "Improved error handling
We've unified how errors returned by model providers are handled and enabled error monitoring using eval functions.
A common production pain point we see is that hosted SOTA language models can still be flaky at times, especially at real scale. With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.
Unified errors
Our users integrate the Humanloop /chat and /completion API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.
Errors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of error response codes.
We've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for type, message, code and origin. The origin field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.
For example, for our /chat  endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for max_tokens, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.
Monitor model reliability with evals
With this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within evaluation functions.
You can now turn on the Errors eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project. Or you can customise this template to track more specific error behaviour.",

    "content": "OpenAI functions in Playground
We've added support for OpenAI functions to our playground!
This builds on our API support and allows you to easily experiment with OpenAI functions within our playground UI.
OpenAI functions are implemented as tools on Humanloop. Tools follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions. You can now define tools as part of your model configuration in the playground. These tools are sent as OpenAI functions when running the OpenAI chat models that support function calling.
The model can choose to return a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call a function. This object is displayed as a special assistant message within the playground. You can then provide the result of the call in a message back to the model to consider, which simulates the function calling workflow.
Use tools in Playground
Take the following steps to use tools for function calling in the playground:
Find tools: Navigate to the playground and locate the Tools section. This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.



Create a new tool: Click on the "Add Tool" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the json-schema syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.



Edit a tool: To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition. This will result in a new model configuration.



Run a model with tools: Once you've defined your tools, you can run the model by pressing the "Run" button.
If the model chooses to call a function, an assistant message will be displayed with the corresponding tool name and arguments to use.

A subsequent Tool message is then displayed to simulate sending the results of the call back to the model to consider.





Save your model config with tools by using the Save button. Model configs with tools defined can then deployed to environments as normal.


Coming soon
Provide the runtime for your tool under the existing pre-defined Tools section  of your organization on Humanloop.",

    "content": "Evaluators
We've added Evaluators to Humanloop in beta!
Evaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the Data tab.
We're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!
Create an Evaluator
If you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new Evaluations tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select + New Evaluator. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.


We'll pick Valid JSON for this guide.


In the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a datapoint argument and should return a value of the chosen type.
Currently, the available return types for an Evaluators are number and boolean. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.
The Datapoint argument
The datapoint passed into your function will be a Python dict with the following structure.
To inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click Random selection in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.


For this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple json.loads call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return False.
Debugging
Once you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.


If your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.
Once you're happy with your Evaluator, click Create in the bottom left of the dialog.
Activate / Deactivate an Evaluator
Your Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the Evaluations tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.
Each Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator on, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to that project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).
You can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.
Aggregations and Graphs
At the top of the Dashboard tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.
At the bottom of the Dashboard tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.


Aggregation
For the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:
Boolean: percentage returning True of the total number of evaluated datapoints

Number: average value across all evaluated datapoints


Data logs
In the Data tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.


From this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose Run evals from the Actions menu in the top right.
Available Modules
The following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:
math

random

datetime

json (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)

jsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)

sqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)

requests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).

    "content": "Introducing Tools
Today we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.
Tools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.
Read more on our blog and see an example of setting up a tool for semantic search.
OpenAI functions API
We've updated our APIs to support OpenAI function calling.
OpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our chat and log endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.
This unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.
Recap on OpenAI functions
As described in the OpenAI documentation, the basic steps for using functions are:
Call one of the models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal json-schema syntax.

The model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.

You can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (NB: the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).

Finally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.


OpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a get_current_weather function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:
Using with Humanloop tools
OpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.
We've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.
In the cases of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.
You can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:
Chat endpoint
We show here how to update the run_conversation() method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:
After running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:

Log endpoint
Alternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:

    "content": "Deployment environments
We've added support for environments to your deployments in Humanloop!
This enables you to deploy your model configurations to specific environments. You'll no longer have to duplicate your projects to manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you'll have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.
Enabling environments for your organisation
Every organisation automatically receives a default production environment. For any of your existing projects that had active deployments define, these have been automatically migrated over to use the default environment with no change in behaviour for the APIs.
You can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's environments page.
Creating an environment
Enter a custom name in the create environment dialog. Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.

The environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.

The default environment
By default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the "Active Deployment," such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed will use this environment.


Renaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.
Using environments
Once created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.
You can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the Deployments section.

Alternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.
Using environments via API

For v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed, you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional environment field.
You can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the "Use API" option.
Clicking on the "Use API" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the environment variable in practice.",

OpenAI Azure support
We've just added support for Azure deployments of OpenAI models to Humanloop!
This update adds the ability to target Microsoft Azure deployments of OpenAI models to the playground and your projects. To set this up, visit your organization's settings.
Enabling Azure OpenAI for your organization
As a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the Azure OpenAI docs for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.

Click the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.
Your endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.
Your API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.
Working with Azure OpenAI models
Once you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.


REST API and Python / TypeScript support
As with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.
In the model_config.model field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).
The request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the provider_api_keys field, as shown in the example above.
Note: Naming Model Deployments
When you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of gpt-35-turbo in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like my-orgs-llm-model.
In order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like gpt-35-turbo, or the base model name with a custom prefix like my-org-gpt-35-turbo. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting max_tokens=-1 in your model configs fail to work as expected.",

Principally, it is an evaluation framework that enables you to rigorously measure and improve LLM performance during development and in production and a collaborative workspace where engineers, PMs and subject matter experts improve prompts, tools and agents together.
By adopting Humanloop, teams save 6-8 engineering hours per project each week and they feel confident that their AI is reliable.






The power of Humanloop lies in its integrated approach to AI development. Evaluation,
monitoring and prompt engineering in one integrated platform enables you to understand system performance and take the actions needed to fix it.
The SDK slots seamlessly into your existing code-based orchestration and the user-friendly interface allows both developers and non-technical stakeholders to adjust the AI together.

    "content": "The principal way you "program" LLMs is through natural language instructions called prompts. There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.
Developing, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:
Subject matter experts matter more than ever. As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.

AI output is often non-deterministic. Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.

AI outputs are subjective. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.




Bad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch
Many companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and engineers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets. The process is slow and error-prone, wasting engineering time and leading to long delays and feelings of uncertainty.",

the model e.g. gpt-4o

A Prompt is callable in that if you supply the necessary inputs, it will return a response from the model.
Inputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. {{topic}} and the value of the variable will need to be supplied when you call the Prompt to create a generation.
This separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different configurations and evaluate any changes.
The Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data in Logs, which can then be used to create Datasets for evaluation purposes.


Note that we use a capitalized "Prompt" to refer to
the entity in Humanloop, and a lowercase "prompt" to refer to the general
concept of input to the model.",

A test Dataset is a collection of Datapoints, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming. Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.
When you run an offline evaluation, a Log needs to be generated using the inputs of each Datapoint and the version of the application being evaluated. Evaluators then need to be run against each Log to provide judgements,
which are then aggregated to provide an overall score for the application. Evaluators in this case take the generated Log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it as arguments.

The prompt.call() Api encapsulates the LLM provider calls (for example openai.Completions.create()), the model-config selection and logging steps in a single unified interface.

Click the "+ Message" button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.


Add the following templated message to the chat template.
This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called topic (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.
On the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the Inputs section for topic.
Add a value fortopic e.g. music, jogging, whatever.

Click Run in the bottom right of the page.


This will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is very funny.
You now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.
Commit your first version of this Prompt

    "content": "To create and use a tool follow the following steps:


Open the editor
Go to a Prompt and open the Editor.
Select a model that supports Tool Calling


To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models
page.
In the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose a model like gpt-4o which supports Tool Calling.
Define the Tool
To get started with tool definition, it's recommended to begin with one of our preloaded example tools. For this guide, we'll use the get_current_weather tool. Select this from the dropdown menu of preloaded examples.
If you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax. When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.


Test it out
Now, let's test our tool by inputting a relevant query. Since we're working with a weather-related tool, try typing: What's the weather in Boston?. This should prompt OpenAI to respond using the parameters we've defined.


Keep in mind that the model's use of the tool depends on the relevance of the user's input. For instance, a question like 'how are you today?' is unlikely to trigger a weather-related tool response.
Check assistant response for a tool call
Upon successful setup, the assistant should respond by invoking the tool, providing both the tool's name and the required data. For our get_current_weather tool, the response might look like this:
Input tool response
After the tool call, the editor will automatically add a partially filled tool message for you to complete.
You can paste in the exact response that the Tool would respond with. For prototyping purposes, you can also just simulate the repsonse yourself (LLMs can handle it!). Provide in a mock response:
To input the tool response:
Find the tool response field in the editor.

Enter theresponse matching the expected format, such as:


Remember, the goal is to simulate the tool's output as if it were actually fetching real-time weather data. This allows you to test and refine your prompt and tool interaction without needing to implement the actual weather API.
Submit tool response
After entering the simulated tool response, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to the AI model.
Review assistant response
The assistant should now respond using the information provided in your simulated tool response. For example, if you input that the weather in London was drizzling at 12°C, the assistant might say:
Based on the current weather data, it's drizzling in London with a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius.
This response demonstrates how the AI model incorporates the tool's output into its reply, providing a more contextual and data-driven answer.


Iterate and refine
Feel free to experiment with different queries and simulated tool responses. This iterative process helps you fine-tune your prompt and understand how the AI model interacts with the tool, ultimately leading to more effective and accurate responses in your application.
Save your Prompt
By saving your prompt, you're creating a new version that includes the tool configuration.
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use tool calling in the Humanloop editor. This powerful feature allows you to simulate and test tool interactions, helping you create more dynamic and context-aware AI applications.
Keep experimenting with different scenarios and tool responses to fully explore the capabilities of your AI model and create even more impressive applications!",

To create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:


Create a new Snippet Tool


Name the Tool
Name it assistant-personalities and give it a description Useful assistant personalities.
Add a key called "helpful-assistant"
In the initial box add helpful-assistant and give it a value of You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.
Add another key called "grumpy-assistant"
Let's add another key-value pair, so press the Add a key/value pair button and add a new key of grumpy-assistant and give it a value of You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy..


Press Create Tool.
Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.
Navigate to the Editor
Go to the Editor of your previously created project.
Add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt
Delete the existing prompt template and add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt.


Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. {{ my-tool-name(key) }}.
Enter the key as an input
In the input area set the value to helpful-assistant. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your key.
Press the Run button
Start the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.


Change the key to grumpy-assistant.


If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to
first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
Play with the LLM
Ask the LLM, I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'. You should see a grumpy response from "Freddy" now.
If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant-personalities("grumpy-assistant") }}. Delete the grumpy-assistant field and add it into your chat template.
Save your Prompt.
If you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.


The Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the Prompts when you update them, as long as the key is the same.


Since the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing
the values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools can affect the Prompt's
behaviour in way that won't be captured by the Prompt's version.
This could be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the
changes are expected.",

Create a new Tool file
Navigate to the homepage or sidebar and click the 'New File' button.
Choose the JSON Schema Tool type
From the available options, select Json Schema as the Tool type.
Define your tool's structure
Paste the following JSON into the provided dialog to define your tool's structure:
If you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax. When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.
Commit this version of the Tool
Press the Commit button to commit this version of the Tool, and set it as the default version by deploying it.
Navigate to the Editor of a Prompt
Switch to a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.


To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models
page.
Add Tool to the Prompt definition.
Select 'Link existing Tool'
In the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option. You should see your get_current_weather tool, click on it to link it to your editor.


Test that the Prompt is working with the tool
Now that your Tool is linked you can start using it. In the Chat section, in the User input, enter "what is the weather in london?"
Press the Run button.
You should see the Assistant respond with the tool response and a new Tool field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in 22 into the tool response and press Run.


The model will respond with The current weather in London is 22 degrees.
Commit the Prompt
You've linked a Tool to your Prompt, now let's save it. Press the Save button and name your Prompt weather-model-config.
(Optional) Update the Tool
Now that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your Prompt, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tool in the sidebar and go to the Editor.
Update the Tool
Let's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:
Commit and deploy the Tool
Press the Commmmit button and then follow the steps to deloy this version of the Tool.
Your Tool is now updated.
Try the Prompt again
Navigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.
In the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.
Check the response
You should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your Prompt.




When updating your Tool, remember that the change will affect all the Prompts
that link to it. Be careful when making updates to not inadvertently change
something you didn't intend.",

A test Dataset is a collection of Datapoints, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming. Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.
When you run an offline evaluation, a Log needs to be generated using the inputs of each Datapoint and the version of the application being evaluated. Evaluators then need to be run against each Log to provide judgements,
which are then aggregated to provide an overall score for the application. Evaluators in this case take the generated Log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it as arguments.

Follow our guide on creating a Prompt.
Steps
To create a Dataset from existing Logs:


Navigate to the Logs of your Prompt
Our Prompt in this example is a Support Agent that answers user queries about Humanloop's product and docs:


Select a subset of the Logs to add
Filter logs on a criteria of interest, such as the version of the Prompt used, then multi-select Logs.
In the menu in the top right of the page, select Add to dataset.


Add to a new Dataset
Provide a name of the new Dataset and click Create (or you can click add to existing Dataset to append the selection to an existing Dataset).
Then provide a suitable commit message describing the datapoints you've added.


You will then see the new Dataset appear at the same level in the filesystem as your Prompt.",

You should have an existing Prompt on Humanloop with a variable defined with our double curly bracket syntax {{variable}}. If not, first follow our guide on creating a Prompt.
In this example, we'll use a Prompt that categorises user queries about Humanloop's product and docs by which feature they relate to.


Steps
To create a dataset from a CSV file, we'll first create a CSV in Google Sheets that contains values for our Prompt variable {{query}} and then upload it to a Dataset on Humanloop.


Create a CSV file.
In our Google Sheets example below, we have a column called query which contains possible values for our Prompt variable {{query}}. You can include as many columns as you have variables in your Prompt template.

There is additionally a column called target which will populate the target output for the classifier Prompt. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.

More complex Datapoints that contain messages and structured objects for targets are suppoerted, but are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be hard-to-read JSON. If you need more complex Datapoints, use the API instead.




Export the Google Sheet to CSV
In Google sheets, choose File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)
Create a new Dataset File
On Humanloop, select New at the bottom of the left hand sidebar, then select Dataset.


Click Upload CSV
First name your dataset when prompted in the sidebar, then select the Upload CSV button and drag and drop the CSV file you created above using the file explorer.
You will then be prompted to provide a commit message to describe the initial state of the dataset.


Follow the link in the pop-up to inspect the Dataset created
You'll see the input-output pairs that were included in the CSV file and you can the rows to inspect and edit the individual Datapoints.",

Steps
Using the API is a great way to integrate Humanloop with your existing data pipeline or just to once-off upload a more complex Dataset that is hard to represent in a CSV file, such as one that contains an array of messages and JSON targets.


Post data to the Datasets API
We first define some sample data that contains user messages and desired responses from our Support Agent Prompt and call the POST /datasets endpoint to upload it as follows:

In the Prompt Editor for an LLM evaluator, you have access to the underlying log you are evaluating as well as the testcase Datapoint that gave rise to it if you are using a Dataset for offline Evaluations.
These are accessed with the standard {{ variable }} syntax, enhanced with a familiar dot notation to pick out specific values from inside the log and testcase objects.
For example, suppose you are evaluating a Log object like this.
In the LLM Evaluator Prompt, {{ log.inputs.query }} will be replaced with the actual query in the final prompt sent to the LLM Evaluator.
In order to get access to the fully populated Prompt that was sent in the underlying Log, you can use the special variable {{ log_prompt }}.

The Evaluator will be initialized to a 5-point rating scale by default.
In this example, we'll set up a feedback schema for a "Tone" Evaluator.
See the Return types documentation for more information on return types.
Select Multi-select within the Return type dropdown. "Multi-select" allows you to apply multiple options to a single Log.

Add the following options, and set the valence for each:
Enthusiastic [positive]

Informative [postiive]

Repetitive [negative]

Technical [negative]

An Evaluation on Humanloop leverages a Dataset, a set of Evaluators and different versions of a Prompt to compare.
The Dataset contains testcases describing the inputs (and optionally the expected results) for a given task. The Evaluators define the criteria for judging the performance of the Prompts when executed using these inputs.
Each of the Prompt versions you want to compare are run against the same Dataset producing Logs; judgements are then provided by Evaluators.
The Evaluation then uses these judgements to provide a summary report of the performance allowing you to systematically compare the performance of the different Prompt versions.",

Navigate to the Evaluations tab of your Prompt
On the left-hand sidebar, click on the Evaluations tab beneath your Prompt.

Click the Evaluate button top right, which presents the setup panel for the Evaluation.




Setup the Evaluation
Select a Dataset using +Dataset.

Add the Prompt versions you want to compare using +Version - note you can multi-select versions in the modal resulting in multiple columns.

Add the Evaluators you want to use to judge the performance of the Prompts using +Evaluator. By default, Cost, Tokens and Latency Evaluators are pre-selected.




By default the system will re-use Logs if they exist for the chosen Dataset, Prompts and Evaluators. This makes it easy to extend reports without paying the cost of re-running your Prompts and Evaluators.
If you want to force the system to re-run the Prompts against the Dataset producing a new batch of Logs, you can select the Manage button in the setup panel and choose +New Batch.
Select Save to trigger the Evaluation report. You will see the report below the setup panel populate with a progress bar and status pending as the Logs are generated on Humanloop.






This guide assumes both the Prompt and Evaluator Logs are generated using the
Humanloop runtime. For certain use cases where more flexibility is required,
the runtime for producing Logs instead lives in your code - see our guide on
Logging, which also works with our
Evaluations feature. We have a guide for how to run Evaluations with Logs
generated in your code coming soon!
Review the results
It will generally take at least a couple of minutes before the Evaluation report is marked as completed as the system generates all the required Prompt and Evaluator Logs.
Once the report is completed, you can review the performance of the different Prompt versions using the Evaluators you selected.
The top spider plot provides you with a summary of the average Evaluator performance across all the Prompt versions.
In our case, gpt-4o, although on average slightly slower and more expensive on average, is significantly better when it comes to User Satisfaction.




Below the spider plot, you can see the breakdown of performance per Evaluator.




To drill into and debug the Logs that were generated, select the Logs button top right of the Evaluation report.
This brings you to the Evaluation Logs table and you can filter and review logs to understand the performance better and replay Logs in our Prompt Editor.",

Human evaluators - Collect feedback from human evaluators using our feedback API. This allows you to incorporate human judgment or in-app actions into your monitoring process.

Create a Slack incoming webhook
Go to your Slack workspace and create a new Slack app (or use an existing one).

Under "Add features and functionality", choose "Incoming Webhooks" and activate them.

Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace" and choose the channel where you want to receive notifications.

Copy the webhook URL provided by Slack.


Import the Humanloop SDK and initialize the client
Replace "your-api-key" with your actual Humanloop API key.
Create a webhook
Replace the following:
"https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK" with your Slack webhook URL

"your-model-name" with the name of the model you want to monitor

"your-shared-secret" with a secret string of your choice for added security


Test the webhook
To test if your webhook is working correctly, you can trigger an evaluation:
Replace "your-project-id" and "your-model-name" with your actual project ID and model name.",

Different use-cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user interaction.
There are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:
Explicit feedback: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.

Implicit feedback: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).

Free-form feedback: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.


You should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.
For example, a Human Evaluator with return type "text" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type "multi_select" can be used to capture user actions
that provide implicit feedback.
If you have not done so, you can follow our guide to create a Human Evaluator to set up the appropriate feedback schema.",

Flows allow you to version your whole AI application on Humanloop (as opposed to just individual Prompts and Tools) and allows you to log and evaluate the full trace of the important processing steps that occur when running your app.
See our cookbook tutorial for examples on how to use Flows in your code.

What's next
We'll soon be extending support for allowing Evaluators to access all Logs inside a trace.
Additionally, we will build on this by adding UI-first visualisations and management of your Flows.
We'll sunset Sessions in favour of Flows in the near future. Reach out to us for guidance on how to migrate your Session-based workflows to Flows.",

    "content": "Human Evaluator upgrades
We've made significant upgrades to Human Evaluators and related workflows to improve your ability to gather Human judgments (sometimes referred to as "feedback") in assessing the quality of your AI applications.
Here are some of the key improvements:
Instead of having to define a limited feedback schema tied to the settings of a specific Prompt, you can now define your schema with a Human Evaluator file and reuse it across multiple Prompts and Tools for both monitoring and offline evaluation purposes.

You are no longer restricted to the default types of Rating, Actions and Issues when defining your feedback schemas from the UI. We've introduced a more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types and valence controls.

We've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now also be used with Tools and other Evaluators (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.

We've improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.


To set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on Evaluator, then click on Human.
This will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a Return type for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.
Tone evaluator set up with options and instructions
You can then reference this Human Evaluator within the Monitoring dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their Evaluations tab.
We've set up default Rating and Correction Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing. We've migrated all your existing Prompt specific feedback schemas to Human Evaluator files and these will continue to work as before with no disruption.
Check out our updated document for further details on how to use Human Evaluators:

We've made improvements to help you evaluate the components of your AI applications, quickly see issues and explore the full context of each evaluation.
A clearer Evaluation tab in Logs
We've given the Log drawer's Evaluation tab a facelift. You can now clearly see what the results are for each of the connected Evaluators.
This means that it's now easier to debug the judgments applied to a Log, and if necessary, re-run code/AI Evaluators in-line.

Ability to re-run Evaluators
We have introduced the ability to re-run your Evaluators against a specific Log. This feature allows you to more easily address and fix issues with previous Evaluator judgments for specific Logs.
You can request a re-run of that Evaluator by opening the menu next to that Evaluator and pressing the "Run Again" option.
Evaluation popover
If you hover over an evaluation result, you'll now see a popover with more details about the evaluation including any intermediate results or console logs without context switching.

We've extended our /chat (in v4) and prompt/call (in v5) endpoints to support this feature. There are two ways to trigger Structured Outputs in the API:
Tool Calling: When defining a tool as part of your Prompt definition, you can now include a strict=true flag. The model will then output JSON data that adheres to the tool parameters schema definition.


Response Format: We have expanded the response_format with option json_schema and a request parameter to also include an optional json_schema field where you can pass in the schema you wish the model to adhere to.


This new response formant functionality is only supported by the latest OpenAPI model snapshots gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.

With Humanloop Evaluation Reports, you can leverage multiple Evaluators for comparing your Prompt and Tool variations. Evaluators can be of different types: code, AI or Human and the progress of the report is dependent on collecting all the required judgements. Human judgments generally take longer than the rest and are collected async by members of your team.
Human Evaluators
To better support this workflow, we've improved the UX around monitoring the status of judgments, with a new progress bar. Your Human Evaluators can now also update the status of the report when they're done.

We've also added the ability to cancel ongoing Evaluations that are pending or running. Humanloop will then stop generating Logs and running Evaluators for this Evaluation report.",

    "content": "Evaluation Comparison Reports
We've released Evaluation reports, which allows you to easily compare the performance of your different Prompts or Tools across multiple different Evaluator criteria.
This generalises our previous concept of Evaluation runs, extending it with multiple complimentary changes with getting more from your evals. All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.


Feature breakdown
We've introduced a new stats comparison view, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.
The performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.
Evaluation reports also introduce an automatic deduplication feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a New Batch in the setup panel.


How to use Evaluation reports
To get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click Evaluate in the top right.
This will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.

When you click Save, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.
What's next
We're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations.",

It also means you get the full power of our file versioning system, allowing you track and commit every change you make Datasets and their Datapoints, with attribution and commit messages inspired by Git.


It's now easy to understand which version of a Dataset was used in a given Evaluation run, and whether the most recent edits to the Dataset were included or not.

For example, Vicuna, an open-source chatbot model based on finetuning LLaMA can be used with the following model name alongside provider: "replicate" in your Prompt version.

Introducing same day support for the Claude 3 - Anthropics new industry leading models. Read more about the release here.
The release contains three models in ascending order of capability: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. This suite provides users with the different options to balance intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific use-cases.


Key take aways
Performance - a new leader. The largest of the 3 models, Opus, is claimed to outperform GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on key benchmarks such as MMLU and Hellaswag. It even reached 84.9% on the Humaneval coding test set (vs GPT-4’s 67%) 🤯

200k context window with near-perfect recall on selected benchmarks. Opus reports 99% accuracy on the NIAH test, which measures how accurately a model can recall information given to it in a large corpus of data.

Opus has vision. Anthropic claim that performance here is on par with that of other leading models (ie GPT-4 and Gemini). They say it’s most useful for inputting graphs, slides etc. in an enterprise setting.

Pricing - as compared to OpenAI:


Opus - 75 (2.5x GPT-4 Turbo)  
Sonnet - 15 (50% of GPT-4 Turbo)

Haiku - $1.25 (1.6x GPT-3.5)
How you can use it: The Claude 3 family is now available on Humanloop. Bring your API key to test, evaluate and deploy the publicly available models - Opus and Sonnet.",

    "content": "New Tool creation flow
You can now create Tools in the same way as you create Prompts and Directories. This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.

To create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.
Tool editor and deployments
You can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.

Tool Editor
This replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.

Deployment
Tools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.
And example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature snippet(key) with a key/value pair of "helpful"/"You are a helpful assistant". You decide you would rather change the value to say "You are a funny assistant", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.
Prompt labels and hover cards
We've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.


The labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.
You'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.


As a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.


Committing Prompt Versions
Building on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.
This is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.
In addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use commits that can take commit messages, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.
We've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.


We'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.

Datapoints are color-coded by the dataset used for the run.
The table is now paginated and does not load your entire project's list of evaluation runs in a single page load. The page should therefore load faster for teams with a large number of runs.
The columns in the table are now filterable and sortable, allowing you to - for example - filter just for the completed runs which test two specific prompt versions on a specific datasets, sorted by their performance under a particular evaluator.",

You can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run.

By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.


Improved Evaluation Debug Console
We've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.

On any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.
After clicking Run to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.

LLM Evaluators
We expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.
After clicking Run on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the LLM Evaluation Log column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.

This is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.

Tool projects
We have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config in the Editor as well as tools managed at organization level.
It is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.

Tool versioning
In the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.
Logs
Any logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our sessions guide and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session
Offline Evaluations via SDK
You can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the Set up evaluations using API guide.
Support for new OpenAI Models
Following OpenAI's latest model releases, you will find support for all the latest models in our Playground and Editor.
GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo
If your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release gpt-4-0125-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.

We also support the new gpt-4-turbo-preview model alias, which points to the latest gpt-4-turbo model without specifying a specific version.
Embedding Models
Finally, the new embedding models - text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are also available for use via Humanloop. The small model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation ada-002 embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space.",

Occasionally, you may launch an evaluation run and then realise that you didn't configure it quite the way you wanted. Perhaps you want to use a different model config or dataset, or would like to halt its progress for some other reason.

    "content": "Evaluation API enhancements
We've started the year by enhancing our evaluations API to give you more flexibility for self-hosting whichever aspects of the evaluation workflow you need to run in your own infrastructure - while leaving the rest to us!
Mixing and matching the Humanloop-runtime with self-hosting
Conceptually, evaluation runs have two components:
Generation of logs for the datapoints using the version of the model you are evaluating.

Evaluating those logs using Evaluators.


Now, using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted (see our guide on external generations for evaluations).
Similarly, evaluating of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app), or self-hosted (see our guide on self-hosted evaluations).
It is now possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime logs and evaluations in any combination you wish.
When creating an Evaluation (via the improved UI dialogue or via the API), you can set the new hl_generated flag to False to indicate that you are posting the logs from your own infrastructure. You can then also include an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.


You can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators.",

    "content": "Human Evaluators
We've introduced a new special type of 'Human' Evaluator to compliment our existing code and AI based Evaluators.
There are many important evaluation use cases that require input from your internal domain experts, or product teams. Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.


Our new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.
Once completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.


Set up your first Human Evaluator run by following our guide.
Return inputs flag
We've introduced a return_inputs flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.
As context model windows get increasingly larger, for example Claude with 200k tokens, it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.
When you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the inputs that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.
As always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.
Gemini
You can now use Google's latest LLMs, Gemini, in Humanloop.
Setup
To use Gemini, first go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey and generate an API key. Then, save this under the "Google" provider on your API keys page.
Head over to the playground, and you should see gemini-pro and gemini-pro-vision in your list of models.


You can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's /chatendpoints.
Features
Gemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.
However, note that while gemini-pro supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, gemini-pro-vision supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to Gemini's docs for more details.
When providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL.",

We've also clarified what the return types are expected as you create your evaluators.
Prompt diffs
Following our recent introduction of our .prompt file, you can now compare your model configs within a project with our new 'diff' view.

As you modify and improve upon your model configs, you might want to remind yourself of the changes that were made between different versions of your model config. To do so, you can now select 2 model configs in your project dashboard and click Compare to bring up a side-by-side comparison between them. Alternatively, open the actions menu and click Compare to deployed.


This diff compares the .prompt files representing the two model configs, and will highlight any differences such as in the model, hyperparameters, or prompt template.
LLM evals - improved data access
In order to help you write better LLM evaluator prompts, you now have finer-grained access to the objects you are evaluating.

It's now possible to manage tool definitions globally for your organization and re-use them across multiple projects by linking them to your model configs.
Prior to this change, if you wanted to re-use the same tool definition across multiple model configs, you had to copy and paste the JSON schema snippet defining the name, description and parameters into your Editor for each case. And if you wanted to make changes to this tool, you would have to recall which model configs it was saved to prior and update them inline 1 by 1.
You can achieve this tool re-use by first defining an instance of our new JsonSchema tool available as another option in your global Tools tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit'), and then link that to as many model configs as you need within the Editor as shown below.
Importantly, updates to the get_current_weather JsonSchema tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the model configs you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the prompt.
The old behaviour of defining the tool inline as part of your model config definition is still available for the cases where you do want changes in the definition of the tool to lead to new versions of the model-config.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the JsonSchema tool card.

With the dialog open, define your tool with name, description, and parameters values. Our guide for using OpenAI Function Calling in the playground can be a useful reference in this case.

There will be more updates soon to improve how logs and prompts are shown in tables and the drawers soon, so if you have ideas for improvements please let us know.
Introducing .prompt files
We're introducing a .prompt file format for representing model configs in a format that's both human-readable and easy to work with.
For certain use cases it can be helpful for engineers to also store their prompts alongside their app's source code in their favourite version control system. The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.
These .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.
Exporting via API
To fetch a .prompt file via the API, make POST request to https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export, where {id} is the ID of the model config (beginning with config_).
Export from Humanloop
You can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click Export .prompt. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).


Editor
Additionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press Cmd-Shift-E when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.


More details on our .prompt file format are available here. We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned.",

Organization roles
Everyone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).
A user can be one of the following rolws:
**Admin:**The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.
Developer:(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.
Member:(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.
RBACs summary
Here is the full breakdown of roles and access:
Action Member Developer Admin 
Create and manage Prompts ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Inspect logs and feedback ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage evaluators ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Run evaluations ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage datasets ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage API keys  ✔️ ✔️ 
Manage prompt deployments  ✔️ ✔️

Self hosted evaluations
We've added support for managing evaluations outside of Humanloop in your own code.
There are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.
For example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or LLM evaluator within your Humanloop project.
With this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.
To better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:
Retrieve your curated datasets

Trigger evaluation runs

Send evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators


Below is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our guide on self-hosted evaluations.
Chat response
We've updated the response models of all of our /chat API endpoints to include an output message object.
Up to this point, our chat and completion endpoints had a unified response model, where the content of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common output field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate tool_calls field.
When making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an output_message field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.
Before:
After:
Snippet tool
We've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.
This functionality is provided by our new Snippet tool. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.
For example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.
Before now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.

When the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.


You can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.
The name field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as assistant below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax {{ assistant(key) }}.
The key is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.
The value is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.

Use the tool
Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.

The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our editor environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.
Above we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the {{ <your-tool-name>(key) }} so in this case it would be {{ assistant(key) }}. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your key, in the screenshot above we used the helpful key to access the You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.


If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant("helpful") }}.

This is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.

    "content": "Parallel tool calling
We've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.
With the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as parallel tool calling.
Editor updates
You can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:
Select one of the new turbo models in the model dropdown.

Specify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.

Make a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.

As shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message




API implications
We've added an additional field tool_calls to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing tool_call parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.
Each element in the tool_calls array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the tool_call_id must be provided, along with role=tool and the content containing the tool response.
Python SDK improvements
We've improved the response models of our Python SDK and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.
Improved response model types
As of versions >= 0.6.0, our Python SDK methods now return Pydantic models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.
Previously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:


With Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from < 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the Raw HTTP Response section.


🚧 Breaking change
Moving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.

Support for timeout parameter
The default timeout used by aiohttp, which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.
In the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passingtimeout=1000 will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.
Multi-modal models
We've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!
We've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V). You can now select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.
Let us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!
Editor quick start
To get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.
Select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown.

Click the Add images button within a user's chat message.

To add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select "Upload image" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.

Note that you can add multiple images




To view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.


API quick start
Assuming you have deployed your gpt-4-vision-preview based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.
Any generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.
Limitations
There are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:
Image messages are only supported by the gpt-4-vision-preview model in chat mode.

GPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.

You cannot add images to the first system message.


JSON mode and seed parameters
We've introduced new model config parameters for JSON mode and Seed in our Editor and API.
With the introduction of the new OpenAI turbo models you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; response_format and seed.



See further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format here and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter here.
These new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for response_format or seed will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.




When using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.
In fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.",

    "content": "LLM Evaluators
Until now, it's been possible to trigger LLM-based evaluations by writing Python code that uses the Humanloop API to trigger the LLM generations.
Today, in order to make this increasingly important workflow simpler and more intuitive, we're releasing LLM Evaluators, which require no Python configuration.
From the Evaluations page, click New Evaluator and select LLM Evaluator.


Instead of a code editor, the right hand side of the page is now a prompt editor for defining instructions to the LLM Evaluator. Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.


In the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual {{ variable }} syntax, and include:
log_inputs - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated

log_prompt - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)

log_messages - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)

log_output - the output produced by the model

log_error - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced

testcase - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.


Take a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.


At the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.
Since an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.
Improved evaluator editor
Given our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.

In the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:
Select the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs

Select the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number


Underneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets.",

Multiple model configs
To run evaluations against multiple model configs it's as simple as selecting the targeted model configs in the run dialog, similar to before, but multiple choices are now supported. This will trigger multiple evaluation runs at once, with each model config selected as a target.

Evaluation table
We've updated our evaluation runs with a table to help view the outcomes of runs in a more condensed form. It also allows you to sort results and trigger re-runs easier. As new evaluators are included, a column will be added automatically to the table.

Re-run previous evaluations
We've exposed the re-run option in the table to allow you to quickly trigger runs again, or use older runs as a way to preload the dialog and change the parameters such as the target dataset or model config.

New OpenAI turbos
Off the back of OpenAI's dev day we've added support for the new turbo models that were announced:
gpt-4-1106-preview

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

Datasets can be created via CSV upload, converting from existing Logs in your project, or by API requests.
See our guides on datasets, which show how to upload from CSV and perform a batch generation across the whole dataset.


Clicking into a dataset, you can explore its datapoints.


A dataset contains a collection of prompt variable inputs (the dynamic values which are interpolated into your model config prompt template at generation-time), as well as a collection of messages forming the chat history, and a target output with data representing what we expect the model to produce when it runs on those inputs.
Datasets are useful for evaluating the behaviour of you model configs across a well-defined collection of test cases. You can use datasets to check for regressions as you iterate your model configs, knowing that you are checking behaviour against a deterministic collection of known important examples.

To set up the tool you need to provide the following details for your API:
Tool parameter Description Example 
Name A unique tool name to reference as a call signature in your prompts get_api_tool 
URL The URL for your API endpoint https://your-api.your-domain.com 
API Key Header The authentication header required by your endpoint. X-API-KEY

Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Get API Call  tool card:


Configure the tool with your API details:


Use the tool
Now your API tool is set up, you can use it to populate input variables in your prompt templates. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. The call signature is the unique tool name with arguments for the query parameters defined when the tool was set up.
In our mock example, the signature will be:  get_user_api(user_id).
An example prompt template using this tool is:
The tool requires an input value to be provided for user_id. In our playground environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat:

We've released a couple of minor useability improvements in the evaluations workflow.
Summary statistics for evaluation runs
When reviewing past runs of evaluations, you can now see summary statistics for each evaluator before clicking into the detail view, allowing for easier comparison between runs.

Re-running evaluations
To enable easier re-running of past evaluations, you can now click the Re-run button in the top-right of the evaluation detail view.

Editor - copy tools
Our Editor environment let's users incorporate OpenAI function calling into their prompt engineering workflows by defining tools. Tools are made available to the model as functions to call using the same universal JSON schema format.
As part of this process it can be helpful to copy the full JSON definition of the tool for quickly iterating on new versions, or copy and pasting it into code. You can now do this directly from the tool definition in Editor:


Selecting the Copy button adds the full JSON definition of the tool to your clipboard:
Single sign on (SSO)
We've added support for SOO to our signup, login and invite flows. By default users can now use their Gmail accounts to access Humanloop.
For our enterprise customers, this also unlocks the ability for us to more easily support their SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) set ups.",

Today, to augment online evaluators, we are releasing offline evaluators as the second part of our evaluations framework.
Offline evaluators provide the ability to test your prompt engineering efforts rigorously in development and CI. Offline evaluators test the performance of your model configs against a pre-defined suite of testcases - much like unit testing in traditional programming.
With this framework, you can use test-driven development practices to iterate and improve your model configs, while monitoring for regressions in CI.

    "content": "Improved error handling
We've unified how errors returned by model providers are handled and enabled error monitoring using eval functions.
A common production pain point we see is that hosted SOTA language models can still be flaky at times, especially at real scale. With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.
Unified errors
Our users integrate the Humanloop /chat and /completion API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.
Errors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of error response codes.
We've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for type, message, code and origin. The origin field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.
For example, for our /chat  endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for max_tokens, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.
Monitor model reliability with evals
With this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within evaluation functions.
You can now turn on the Errors eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project. Or you can customise this template to track more specific error behaviour.",

    "content": "OpenAI functions in Playground
We've added support for OpenAI functions to our playground!
This builds on our API support and allows you to easily experiment with OpenAI functions within our playground UI.
OpenAI functions are implemented as tools on Humanloop. Tools follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions. You can now define tools as part of your model configuration in the playground. These tools are sent as OpenAI functions when running the OpenAI chat models that support function calling.
The model can choose to return a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call a function. This object is displayed as a special assistant message within the playground. You can then provide the result of the call in a message back to the model to consider, which simulates the function calling workflow.
Use tools in Playground
Take the following steps to use tools for function calling in the playground:
Find tools: Navigate to the playground and locate the Tools section. This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.



Create a new tool: Click on the "Add Tool" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the json-schema syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.



Edit a tool: To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition. This will result in a new model configuration.



Run a model with tools: Once you've defined your tools, you can run the model by pressing the "Run" button.
If the model chooses to call a function, an assistant message will be displayed with the corresponding tool name and arguments to use.

A subsequent Tool message is then displayed to simulate sending the results of the call back to the model to consider.





Save your model config with tools by using the Save button. Model configs with tools defined can then deployed to environments as normal.


Coming soon
Provide the runtime for your tool under the existing pre-defined Tools section  of your organization on Humanloop.",

    "content": "Evaluators
We've added Evaluators to Humanloop in beta!
Evaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the Data tab.
We're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!
Create an Evaluator
If you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new Evaluations tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select + New Evaluator. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.


We'll pick Valid JSON for this guide.


In the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a datapoint argument and should return a value of the chosen type.
Currently, the available return types for an Evaluators are number and boolean. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.
The Datapoint argument
The datapoint passed into your function will be a Python dict with the following structure.
To inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click Random selection in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.


For this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple json.loads call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return False.
Debugging
Once you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.


If your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.
Once you're happy with your Evaluator, click Create in the bottom left of the dialog.
Activate / Deactivate an Evaluator
Your Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the Evaluations tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.
Each Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator on, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to that project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).
You can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.
Aggregations and Graphs
At the top of the Dashboard tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.
At the bottom of the Dashboard tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.


Aggregation
For the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:
Boolean: percentage returning True of the total number of evaluated datapoints

Number: average value across all evaluated datapoints


Data logs
In the Data tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.


From this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose Run evals from the Actions menu in the top right.
Available Modules
The following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:
math

random

datetime

json (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)

jsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)

sqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)

requests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).

Similarly, our other methods such as humanloop.complete_deployed(), humanloop.chat(), and humanloop.log() etc. support session_reference_id.
If you're using our API directly, you can pass session_reference_id within the request body in your POST /v4/completion etc. endpoints.
Further details
For a more detailed walkthrough on how to use session_reference_id, check out our guide that runs through how to record datapoints to a session in an example script.",

    "content": "Introducing Tools
Today we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.
Tools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.
Read more on our blog and see an example of setting up a tool for semantic search.
OpenAI functions API
We've updated our APIs to support OpenAI function calling.
OpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our chat and log endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.
This unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.
Recap on OpenAI functions
As described in the OpenAI documentation, the basic steps for using functions are:
Call one of the models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal json-schema syntax.

The model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.

You can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (NB: the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).

Finally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.


OpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a get_current_weather function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:
Using with Humanloop tools
OpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.
We've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.
In the cases of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.
You can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:
Chat endpoint
We show here how to update the run_conversation() method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:
After running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:

Log endpoint
Alternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:

    "content": "Deployment environments
We've added support for environments to your deployments in Humanloop!
This enables you to deploy your model configurations to specific environments. You'll no longer have to duplicate your projects to manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you'll have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.
Enabling environments for your organisation
Every organisation automatically receives a default production environment. For any of your existing projects that had active deployments define, these have been automatically migrated over to use the default environment with no change in behaviour for the APIs.
You can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's environments page.
Creating an environment
Enter a custom name in the create environment dialog. Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.

The environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.

The default environment
By default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the "Active Deployment," such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed will use this environment.


Renaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.
Using environments
Once created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.
You can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the Deployments section.

Alternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.
Using environments via API

For v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed, you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional environment field.
You can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the "Use API" option.
Clicking on the "Use API" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the environment variable in practice.",

OpenAI Azure support
We've just added support for Azure deployments of OpenAI models to Humanloop!
This update adds the ability to target Microsoft Azure deployments of OpenAI models to the playground and your projects. To set this up, visit your organization's settings.
Enabling Azure OpenAI for your organization
As a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the Azure OpenAI docs for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.

Click the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.
Your endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.
Your API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.
Working with Azure OpenAI models
Once you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.


REST API and Python / TypeScript support
As with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.
In the model_config.model field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).
The request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the provider_api_keys field, as shown in the example above.
Note: Naming Model Deployments
When you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of gpt-35-turbo in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like my-orgs-llm-model.
In order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like gpt-35-turbo, or the base model name with a custom prefix like my-org-gpt-35-turbo. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting max_tokens=-1 in your model configs fail to work as expected.",

Enabling Cohere for your organization


Working with Cohere models
Once you've successfully enabled Cohere for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects, in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.


REST API and Python / TypeScript support
As with other model providers, once you've set up a Cohere-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.
If you don't provide a Cohere API key under the provider_api_keys field, the request will fall back on the stored organization level key you configured above.",

Migration from 0.3.x
For those coming from an older SDK version, this introduces some breaking changes. A brief highlight of the changes:
The client initialization step of hl.init(...) is now humanloop = Humanloop(...).
Previously provider_api_keys could be provided in hl.init(...). They should now be provided when constructing Humanloop(...) client.




hl.generate(...)'s various call signatures have now been split into individual methods for clarity. The main ones are:
humanloop.complete(project, model_config={...}, ...) for a completion with the specified model config parameters.

humanloop.complete_deployed(project, ...) for a completion with the project's active deployment.",

By adopting Humanloop, teams save 6-8 engineering hours each week through better workflows and they feel confident that their AI is reliable.






The power of Humanloop lies in its integrated approach to AI development. Evaluation, monitoring and prompt engineering in one platform enables you to understand system performance and take the actions needed to fix it. Additionally, the SDK slots seamlessly into your existing code-based orchestration and the user-friendly interface allows both developers and non-technical stakeholders to adjust the AI together.

    "content": "The principal way you "program" large language models is through natural language instruction called prompts. There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.
Developing, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:
Subject matter experts matter more than ever. As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.

AI output is often non-deterministic. Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.

AI outputs are subjective. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.




Bad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch
Many companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and developers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets. The process is slow and error-prone, wasting engineering time and leading to long delays and feelings of uncertainty.",

Click the “+ Message” button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.


Add the following templated message to the chat template.
This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called topic (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.
On the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the Inputs section for topic.
Add a value for topic e.g. music, jogging, whatever

Click Run in the bottom right of the page


This will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is very funny.

Go to your project dashboard. At the top left of the page, click menu of "production" environment card. Within that click the button Change deployment and set a new model config as active; calls to humanloop.complete_deployed will now use this new model. Now go back to the app and see the effect!",

Run npx create-next-app@latest to create a fresh Next.js project. Accept all the default config options in the setup wizard (which includes using TypeScript, Tailwind, and the Next.js app router). Now npm run dev to fire up the development server.
Next npm i humanloop to install the Humanloop SDK in your project.
Edit app/page.tsx to the following. This code stubs out the basic React components and state management we need for a chat interface.


We shouldn't call the Humanloop SDK from the client's browser as this would
require giving out the Humanloop API key, which you should not do! Instead,
we'll create a simple backend API route in Next.js which can perform the
Humanloop requests on the Node server and proxy these back to the client.
Create a file containing the code below at app/api/chat/route.ts. This will automatically create an API route at /api/chat. In the call to the Humanloop SDK, you'll need to pass the project name you created in step 1.
In this code, we're calling humanloop.chatDeployed. This function is used to target the model which is actively deployed on your project - in this case it should be the model we set up in step 1. Other related functions in the SDK reference (such as humanloop.chat) allow you to target a specific model config (rather than the actively deployed one) or even specify model config directly in the function call.
When we receive a response from Humanloop, we strip out just the text of the chat response and send this back to the client via a Response object (see Next.js - Route Handler docs). The Humanloop SDK response contains much more data besides the raw text, which you can inspect by logging to the console.
For the above to work, you'll need to ensure that you have a .env.local file at the root of your project directory with your Humanloop API key. You can generate a Humanloop API key by clicking your name in the bottom left and selecting API keys. This environment variable will only be available on the Next.js server, not on the client (see Next.js - Environment Variables).
Now, modify page.tsx to use a fetch request against the new API route.
You should now find that your application works as expected. When we send messages from the client, a GPT response appears beneath (after a delay).


Back in your Humanloop Prompt dashboard you should see Logs being recorded as clients interact with your model.",

You may notice that model responses can take a while to appear on screen. Currently, our Next.js API route blocks while the entire response is generated, before finally sending the whole thing back to the client browser in one go. For longer generations, this can take some time, particularly with larger models like GPT-4. Other model config settings can impact this too.
To provide a better user experience, we can deal with this latency by streaming tokens back to the client as they are generated and have them display eagerly on the page. The Humanloop SDK wraps the model providers' streaming functionality so that we can achieve this. Let's incorporate streaming tokens into our app next.
Edit the API route at to look like the following. Notice that we have switched to using the humanloop.chatDeployedStream function, which offers Server Sent Event streaming as new tokens arrive from the model provider.
Now, modify the onSend function in page.tsx to the following. This streams the response body in chunks, updating the UI each time a new chunk arrives.
You should now find that tokens stream onto the screen as soon as they are available.",

The left hand side of the screen defines your Prompt – the parameters such as model, temperature and template. The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.


Click the "+ Message" button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.


Add the following templated message to the chat template.
This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called topic (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.
On the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the Inputs section for topic.
Add a value fortopic e.g. music, jogging, whatever.

Click Run in the bottom right of the page.


This will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is very funny.
You now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.
Commit your first version of this Prompt
Click the Commit button

Put “initial version” in the commit message field

Click Commit

Different use cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user interaction. There are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:
Explicit feedback: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.

Implicit feedback: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).

Free-form feedback: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.",

Deferred output population

For instance, the root-level Agent will spin off multiple LLM requests before it can retrieve an output. To support this case, we allow logging without an output.

A test dataset is a collection of datapoints, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming. Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.
When you run an offline evaluation, Humanloop iterates through each datapoint in the dataset and triggers a fresh LLM generation using the inputs of the testcase and the model config being evaluated. For each test case, your evaluator function will be called, taking as arguments the freshly generated log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it.

Using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted. Similarly, evaluations of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app) or self-hosted (see our guide on self-hosted evaluations).
In fact, it's possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime generations and evaluations in any combination you wish. When creating an evaluation via the API, set the hl_generated flag to False to indicate that you are posting the logs from your own infrastructure (see our guide on evaluating externally-generated logs). Include an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure. You can include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include any combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators.

In order to effectively leverage LLMs in production, having confidence in how

software and non-generative machine learning (ML) models, evaluation is
subjective, hard to automate and the risk of the system going embarrassingly

    "content": "It’s important to first understand the basic makeup of what we are evaluating
when working with LLMs in production. As the models get increasingly more
powerful, a significant amount of effort is spent trying to give the model the
appropriate context and access required to solve a task.


For the current generation of models, at the core of any LLM app is usually some
combination of the following components:
LLM model - the core reasoning engine; an API into OpenAI, Anthropic,
Google, or open source alternatives like
Mistral.

Prompt template - the boilerplate instructions to your model, which are
shared between requests. This is generally versioned and managed like code
using formats like the
.prompt file.

Data sources - to provide the relevant context to the model; often
referred to as retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Examples being
traditional relational databases, graph databases, and
vector databases.

Memory - like a data source, but that builds up a history of previous
interactions with the model for re-use.

Tools - provides access to actions like API calls and code execution
empowering the model to interact with external systems where appropriate.

Agent control flow - some form of looping logic that allows the model to
make multiple generations to solve a task before hitting some stopping
criteria.

Guardrails - a check that is run on the output of the model before
returning the output to the user. This can be simple logic, for example
looking for certain keywords, or another model. Often triggering fallback to
human-in-the-loop workflows",

    "content": "These individual components represent a large and unique design space to
navigate. The configuration of each one requires careful consideration; it's no
longer just strictly prompt engineering.
For example, take the vector database - now a mainstay for the problem of
providing the relevant chunks of context to the model, for a particular query,
from a larger corpus of documents. There is a near infinite number of open or
closed source vector stores to choose from. Then there is the embedding model
(that also has its own design choices), retrieval technique, similarity metric,
how to chunk your documents, how to sync your vector store... and the list goes
on.
Not only that, but there are often complex interactions between these components
that are hard to predict. For example, maybe the performance of your prompt
template is weirdly sensitive to the format of the separator tokens you forgot
to strip when chunking your documents in the vector database (a real personal
anecdote).
Furthermore, we're seeing applications that have multiple specialist blocks of
these components chained together to solve a task. This all adds to the
challenge of evaluating the resulting complex system. Specialist tooling is
increasingly a necessity to help teams build robust applications.
Like for testing in traditional software development, the goal of a good LLM
evaluation framework is to provide confidence that the system is working as
expected and also transparency into what might be causing issues when things go
wrong. Unlike traditional software development, a significant amount of
experimentation and collaboration is required when building with LLMs. From
prompt engineering with domain experts, to tool integrations with engineers. A
systematic way to track progress is required.",

End-to-end - emulate the experience of an end UI user or API caller; they

when it comes to this type of testing. Of the test types, the most difficult to
transfer over to LLMs is the unit test because of:
Randomness - LLMs produce probabilities over words which can result in
random variation between generations for the same prompt. Certain
applications, like task automation, require deterministic predictions. Others,
like creative writing, demand diversity.

Subjectivity - we oftentimes want LLMs to produce natural human-like
interactions. This requires more nuanced approaches to evaluation because of
the inherent subjectivity of the correctness of outputs, which may depend on
context or user preferences.

Cost and latency - given the computation involved, running SOTA LLMs can
come with a significant cost and tend to have relatively high latency;
especially if configured as an agent that can take multiple steps.

Scope - LLMs are increasingly capable of solving broader less well-defined
tasks, resulting in the scope of what we are evaluating often being a lot more
open-ended than in traditional software applications.


As a result, the majority of automation efforts in evaluating LLM apps take the
form of integration and end-to-end style tests and should be managed as such

Load and usage patterns in the wild can be unexpected and lead to bugs.
Traditional observability solutions like Datadog

error codes. This tends to fall short when it comes to LLMs. The more capable
and complex the system, the harder it can be to determine something actually
went wrong and the more important observability and traceability is.
Furthermore, one of the promises of building with LLMs is the potential to more
rapidly intervene and experiment. By tweaking instructions you can fix issues
and improve performance. Another advantage is that less technical teams can be
more involved in building; the
makeup of the teams
is evolving. This impacts what's needed from an observability solution in this
setting. A tighter integration between observability data and the development
environment to make changes is more beneficial, as well as usability for
collaborating with product teams and domain experts outside of engineering. This
promise of more rapid and sometimes non-technical iteration cycles also

Binary - involves a yes/no, true/false, or pass/fail judgment based on
some criteria.

Categorical - involves more than two categories; for exampling adding an
abstain or maybe option to a binary judgment.

Ranking - the relative quality of output from different samples or
variations of the model are being ranked from best to worst based on some
criteria. Preference based judgments are often used in evaluating the quality
of a ranking.

Numerical - involves a score, a percentage, or any other kind of numeric
rating.

Text - a simple comment or a more detailed critique. Often used when a
more nuanced or detailed evaluation of the model's output is required.

Multi-task - combines multiple types of judgment simultaneously. For
example, a model's output could be evaluated using both a binary rating and a
free-form text explanation.


Simple individual judgments can be easily aggregated across a dataset of
multiple examples using well known metrics. For example, for classification
problems, precision,
recall and
F1 are typical choices. For rankings,
there are metrics like
NDCG,
Elo ratings and
Kendall's Tau.
For numerical judgments there are variations of the
Bleu score.

    "content": "Sourcing judgments is an area where there are new and evolving patterns around
foundation models like LLMs. At Humanloop, we've standardised around the
following canonical sources:
Heuristic/Code - using simple deterministic rules based judgments against
attributes like cost, token usage, latency, regex rules on the output, etc.
These are generally fast and cheap to run at scale.

Model (or 'AI') - using other foundation models to provide judgments on
the output of the component. This allows for more qualitative and nuanced
judgments for a fraction of the cost of human judgments.

Human - getting gold standard judgments from either end users of your
application, or internal domain experts. This can be the most expensive and
slowest option, but also the most reliable.





Model judgments in particular are increasingly promising and an active research
area. The paper Judging LLM-as-a-Judge
demonstrates that an appropriately prompted GPT-4 model achieves over 80%
agreement with human judgments when rating LLM model responses to questions on a
scale of 1-10; that's equivalent to the levels of agreement between humans.
Such evaluators can be equally effective in evaluating the important non-LLM
components, such as the retrieval component in RAG. In
Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation
a GPT-3 model is tasked with extracting the most relevant sentences from the
retrieved context. A numeric judgment for relevance is then computed using the
ratio of the number of relevant to irrelevant sentences, which was also found to
be highly correlated with expert human judgments.
However, there are risks to consider. The same reasons that evaluating LLMs is
hard apply to using them as evaluators. Recent research has also shown LLMs to
have biases that can contaminate the evaluation process. In
Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators
they measure 6 cognitive biases across 15 different LLM variations. They find
that simple details such as the order of the results presented to the model can
have material impact on the evaluation.



The takeaway here is that it's important to still experiment with performance on
your target use cases before trusting LLM evaluators - evaluate the evaluator!
All the usual prompt engineering techniques such as including few-shot examples
are just as applicable here. In addition, fine-tuning specialist, more
economical evaluator models using human judgements can be a real unlock.
I believe teams should consider shifting more of their human judgment efforts up
a level to focus on helping improve model evaluators. This will ultimately lead
to a more scalable, repeatable and cost-effective evaluation process. As well as
one where the human expertise can be more targeted on the most important high
value scenarios.",

There are lots of broad themes to crib from. Humanloop for example provides
templates for popular use cases and best practises, with the ability to
experiment and customize. There are categories like general performance
(latency, cost and error thresholds), behavioural (tone of voice, writing style,
diversity, factuality, relevance, etc.), ethical (bias, safety, privacy, etc.)
and user experience (engagement, satisfaction, productivity, etc.).
Unsurprisingly, starting with a small set of evaluators that cover the most
important criteria is wise. These can then be adapted and added to over time as
requirements are clarified and new edge cases uncovered. Tradeoffs are often
necessary between these criteria. For example, a more diverse set of responses
might be more engaging, but also more likely to contain errors and higher
quality can often come at a cost in terms of latency.
Thinking about these criteria upfront for your project can be a good hack to

    "content": "As discussed with the distinction between CI and observability; different stages
of the app development lifecycle will have different evaluation needs. I've
found this lifecycle to naturally still consist of some sort of planning and
scoping exercise, followed by cycles of development, deployment and monitoring.
These cycles are then repeated during the lifetime of the LLM app in order to
intervene and improve performance. The stronger the teams, the more agile and
continuous this process tends to be.
Development here will include both the typical app development; orchestrating
your LLM blocks in code, setting up your UIs, etc, as well more LLM specific
interventions and experimentation; including prompt engineering, context
tweaking, tool integration updates and fine-tuning - to name a few. Both the
choices and quality of interventions to
optimize your LLM performance are
much improved if the right evaluation stages are in place. It facilitates a more
data-driven, systematic approach.
From my experience there are 3 complementary stages of evaluation that are
highest ROI in supporting rapid iteration cycles of the LLM block related
interventions:
Interactive - it's useful to have an interactive playground-like editor
environment that allows rapid experimentation with components of the model
and provides immediate evaluator feedback. This usually works best on a
relatively small number of scenarios. This allows teams (both technical and
non-technical) to quickly explore the design space of the LLM app and get an
informal sense of what works well.

Batch offline - benchmarking or regression testing the most promising
variations over a larger curated set of scenarios to provide a more
systematic evaluation. Ideally a range of different evaluators for different
components of the app can contribute to this stage, some comparing against
gold standard expected results for the task. This can fit naturally into
existing CI processes.

Monitoring online - post deployment, real user interactions can be
evaluated continuously to monitor the performance of the model. This process
can drive alerts, gather additional scenarios for offline evaluations and
inform when to make further interventions. Staging deployments through
internal environments, or beta testing with selected cohorts of users first,
are usually super valuable.





It's usually necessary to co-evolve to some degree the evaluation framework
alongside the app development as more data becomes available and requirements
are clarified. The ability to easily version control and share across stages and
teams both the evaluators and the configuration of your app can significantly
improve the efficiency of this process.",

sources of this kind of data are actually the interactive and monitoring stages
discussed above.
With access to an interactive environment for prompt engineering (or a test
version of your application), internal domain experts can synthesize examples of
the kinds of interactions they expect to see in production. These interactions
should be recorded throughout the course of initial experimentation to form a
benchmark dataset for subsequent offline evaluations.
For leveraging real end-user interactions, a tighter integration between
observability data and the development environment that manages evaluations
makes it easier to curate real scenarios into your benchmark datasets over time.



Something worth careful consideration to maximise the impact of end-user
interactions is to set up your application to
capture rich feedback
from users form the start. This is an example of an online evaluator that relies
on human judgments, which can be used to filter for particularly interesting
scenarios to add to benchmark datasets.
Feedback doesn't need to be only explicit from the user; it can be provided
implicitly in the way they interact with the system. For example,
github copilot reportedly
monitors whether the code suggestion was accepted at various time increments
after the suggestion was made, as well as whether the user made any edits to the

    "content": "Once you have a small amount of high quality data leveraging LLMs to generate
additional input examples can help bootstrap to larger datasets. By utilizing
few-shot prompting and including a representative subset of your existing data
within the prompt, you can guide the synthesizer model to generate a wide range
of supplementary examples.
A quick pointer here is to prompt the model to generate a batch of examples at a
time, rather than one at a time, such that you can encourage characteristics
like diversity between examples. Or, similarly, feed previously generated
examples back into your prompt. For instance, for a customer service system,
prompts could be designed to elicit responses across a variety of emotional
states, from satisfaction to frustration.
A specific example of this is model red-teaming, or synthesizing adversarial
examples. This is where you use the synthesizer model to generate examples that
are designed to break the system. For example, in
Red Teaming Language Models with Language Models,
they uncover offensive replies, data leakage and other vulnerabilities in an LLM
chat-bot using variations of few-shot prompts to generate adversarial questions.
They also leverage a pre-trained offensive classifier to help automate their
evaluation process. However, it is worth noting they too point out the
limitations caused by LLM biases that limits diversity. They ultimately need to
generate and filter hundreds of thousands of synthetic examples.

evaluating the quality of the synthetic data generator model before trusting it.",

Increasing adoption of AI based evaluators for all components of these
systems, with improved support for fine-tuning and specialisation happening at
this level. The existence of OpenAI's
Superalignment team
shows there is focus here on the research front.

Supporting more multi-modal applications deployed in production, with more
text, image, voice and even video based models coming online.

More complex agent-based workflows and experimenting with more multi-agent
setups and how evaluation needs to adapt to supervise these systems.

Moving towards more end-to-end optimization for the components of these
complex systems. A robust set of evaluators can provide an objective to
measure performance, coupled with data synthesization to simulate the system.

Choose Start from scratch
For this example, we'll use the code below to compare the LLM generated output with what we expected for that testcase.
Use the Debug Console
In the debug console at the bottom of the dialog, click Load data and then Datapoints from dataset. Select the dataset you created in the previous section. The console will be populated with its datapoints.


Choose a model config from the dropdown menu.
Click the run button at the far right of one of the test datapoints.
A new debug run will be triggered, which causes an LLM generation using that datapoint's inputs and messages parameters. The generated log and the test datapoint will be passed to the evaluator, and the resulting evaluation will be displayed in the Result column.

Alternatively, if your model config lives outside the Humanloop system, post it to Humanloop with the register model config endpoint.
Either way, you need the ID of the config.
In the Humanloop app, create an evaluator
We'll create a Valid JSON checker for this guide.
Visit the Evaluations tab, and select Evaluators

Click + New Evaluator and choose Code from the options.

Select the Valid JSON preset on the left.

Choose the mode Offline in the settings panel on the left.

Click Create.

Copy your new evaluator's ID from the address bar. It starts with evfn_.


Create an evaluation run with hl_generated set to False
This tells the Humanloop runtime that it should not trigger evaluations but wait for them to be posted via the API.
By default, the evaluation status after creation is pending. Before sending the generation logs, set the status to running.
Iterate through the datapoints in the dataset, produce a generation and post the evaluation
Run the full script above.
If everything goes well, you should now have posted a new evaluation run to Humanloop and logged all the generations derived from the underlying datapoints.
The Humanloop evaluation runtime will now iterate through those logs and run the Valid JSON evaluator on each. To check progress:
Visit your project in the Humanloop app and go to the Evaluations tab.
You should see the run you recently created; click through to it, and you'll see rows in the table showing the generations.




In this case, all the evaluations returned False because the "Hello World!" string wasn't valid JSON. Try logging something valid JSON to check that everything works as expected.",

Inputs: a collection of prompt variable values which are interpolated into the prompt template of your model config at generation time (i.e. they replace the {{ variables }} you define in the prompt template.

Messages: for chat models, as well as the prompt template, you may have a history of prior chat messages from the same conversation forming part of the input to the next generation. Datapoints can have these messages included as part of the input.

Target: data representing the expected or intended output of the model. In the simplest case, this can simply be a string representing the exact output you hope the model produces for the example represented by the datapoint. In more complex cases, you can define an arbitrary JSON object for target with whatever fields are necessary to help you specify the intended behaviour. You can then use our evaluations feature to run the necessary code to compare the actual generated output with your target data to determine whether the result was as expected.

A Prompt in Humanloop


To create a dataset from a CSV file, we'll first create a CSV in Google Sheets and then upload it to a dataset in Humanloop.


Create a CSV file.
In our Google Sheets example below, we have a column called user_query which is an input to a prompt variable of that name. So in our model config, we'll need to include {{ user_query }} somewhere, and that placeholder will be populated with the value from the user_query input in the datapoint at generation-time.

You can include as many columns of prompt variables as you need for your model configs.

There is additionally a column called target which will populate the target of the datapoint. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.

Note: messages are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be verbose and hard-to-read JSON. If you want a dataset with messages, consider using the API to upload, or convert from existing logs.




Export the Google Sheet to CSV
Choose File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)
Create a new Dataset File
Click Upload CSV
Uupload the CSV file from step 2 by drag-and-drop or using the file explorer.


Click Upload Dataset from CSV
You should see a new dataset appear in the datasets tab. You can explore it by clicking in.
Follow the link in the pop-up to inspect the dataset that was created in the upload.
You'll see a column with the input key-value pairs for each datapoint, a messages column (in our case we didn't use messages, so they're all empty) and a target column with the expected model output.",

We want to get the model to classify the customer support query into the appropriate category. For this dataset, we have specified the correct category for each datapoint, so we'll be able to know easily if the model produced the correct output.


In Editor, create a simple completion model config as below.


We've used the following prompt:
You are a customer support classifier for Humanloop, a platform for building applications with LLMs.
Please classify the following customer support query into one of these categories:
[datasets, docs, evaluators, feedback, fine-tuning, model configs, model providers]
{{user_query}}
The most important thing here is that we have included a prompt variable - {{ user_query }} which corresponds to the input key on all the datapoints in our dataset. This was the first column header in the CSV file we used to upload the dataset.
Save the model config by clicking the Save button. Call the config support_classifier.
Go to the Datasets tab
Click the menu icon in the top-right corner of the dataset you want to perform a batch generation across.
In that menu, choose Batch Generate & Eval


In the dialog window, choose the support_classifier model config created in step 2.
You can also optionally select an evaluator to use to compare the model's generation output to the target output in each datapoint. We set up the Exact match offline evaluator in our project (it's one of the builtins and requires no further configuration).
Click Batch generate
Follow the link in the pop-up to the batch generation run which is under the Evaluations tab.


The output the model produced is shown in the output column, and the exact match column shows that the model produced the expected (target) output in most cases. From here, we could inspect the failing cases and iterate on our model config before testing again to see if the accuracy across the whole dataset has improved.",

You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our Prompt creation guide first.




To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models page.
To create and use a tool follow the following steps:


Open the editor
Start by opening the Humanloop Editor in your web browser. You can access this directly from your Humanloop account dashboard.
Select the model
In the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose gpt-4 from the dropdown list.
Define the tool
To define a tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax syntax. For the purpose of this guide, let's select one of our preloaded example tools get_current_weather. In practice this would correspond to a function you have defined locally, in your own code, and you are defining the parameters and structure that you want OpenAI to respond with to integrate with that function.


Input user text
Let's input some user text relevant to our tool to trigger OpenAI to respond with the corresponding parameters. Since we're using a weather-related tool, type in: What's the weather in Boston?.


It should be noted that a user can ask a non-weather related question such as 'how are you today? ' and it likely wouldn't trigger the model to respond in a format relative to the tool.
Check assistant response
If correctly set up, the assistant should respond with a prompt to invoke the tool, including the name of the tool and the data it requires. For our get_current_weather tool, it might respond with the relevant tool name as well as the fields you requested, such as:
Input tool parameters
The response can be used locally or for prototyping you can pass in any relevant values. In the case of our get_current_weather tool, we might respond with parameters such as temperature (e.g., 22) and weather condition (e.g., sunny). To do this, in the tool response add the parameters in the in the format { "temperature": 22, "condition": "sunny" }. To note, the response format is also flexible, inputting 22, sunny likely also works and might help you iterate more quickly in your experimentation.
Submit tool response
After defining the parameters, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to OpenAI.
Review assistant response
The assistant should now respond using your parameters. For example, it might say: The current weather in Boston is sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees.


Save the model config
If you are happy with your tool, you can save the model config. The tool will be saved on that model config and can be used again in the future by loading the model config again in the editor or by calling the model config via our SDK.",

Import the Humanloop SDK: If you haven't done so already, you'll need to install and import the Humanloop SDK into your Python environment. You can do this using pip:
Note, this guide was built with Humanloop==0.5.18.
Then import the SDK in your script:
Initialize the SDK: Initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API key:
Create a chat with the tool: We'll start with the general chat endpoint format.
Define the tool: Define a tool using the universal JSON Schema syntax syntax. Let's assume we've defined a get_current_weather tool, which returns the current weather for a specified location. We'll add it in via a "tools": tools, field. We've also defined a dummy get_current_weather method at the top. This can be replaced by your own function to fetch real values, for now we're hardcoding it to return a random temperature and cloudy for this example.
Check assistant response
The code above will make the call to OpenAI with the tool but it does nothing to handle the assistant response. When responding with a tool response the response should have a tool_calls field. Fetch that value and pass it to your own function. An example of this can be seen below. Replace the TODO - Add assistant handling logic in your code from above with the following. Multiple tool calls can be returned with the latest OpenAI models gpt-4-1106-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, so below we loop through the tool_calls and populate the response accordingly.
Return the tool response
We can then return the tool response to OpenAI. This can be done by formatting OpenAI tool message into the relative assistant message seen below along with a tool message with the function name and function response.
Review assistant response
The assistant should respond with a message that incorporates the parameters you provided, for example: The current weather in Boston is 22 degrees and cloudy. The above can be run by adding the python handling logic at the both of your file:

Create a Tool file
Click the 'New File' button on the homepage or in the sidebar.
Select the Json Schema Tool type
Define your tool
Set the name, description, and parameters values. Our guide for using Tool Calling in the Prompt Editor can be a useful reference in this case. We can use the get_current_weather schema in this case. Paste the following into the dialog:
Press the Create button.
Navigate to the Editor
Make sure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.


See the Models page for a list of models that support tool calling.
Add Tool to the Prompt definition.
Select 'Link existing Tool'
In the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option. You should see your get_current_weather tool, click on it to link it to your editor.


Test that the Prompt is working with the tool
Now that your tool is linked you can start using it as you would normally use an inline tool. In the Chat section, in the User input, enter "What is the weather in london?"
Press the Run button.
You should see the Assistant respond with the tool response and a new Tool field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in 22 into the tool response and press Run.


The model will respond with The current weather in London is 22 degrees.
Save the Prompt
You've linked a tool to your model config, now let's save it. Press the Save button and name your model config weather-model-config.
(Optional) Update the Tool
Now that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your model config, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tools in the sidebar and go to the Editor.
Change the tool.
Let's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:
Save the Tool
Press the Save button, then the following Continue button to confirm.
Your tool is now updated.
Try the Prompt again
Navigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.
In the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.
Check the response
You should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your model config.




When updating your organization-level JSON Schema tools, remember that the
change will affect all the places you've previously linked the tool. Be
careful when making updates to not inadvertently change something you didn't
intend.",

To create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:


Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.


Name the tool
Name itassistant-personalities and give it a description Useful assistant personalities.
Add a snippet called "helpful-assistant"
In the initial box add helpful-assistant and give it a value of You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.
Add another snippet called "grumpy-assistant"
Let's add another key-value pair, so press the Add a key/value pair button and add a new key of grumpy-assistant and give it a value of You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy..


Press Create Tool.
Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.
Navigate to the Editor
Go to the Editor of your previously created project.
Add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt
Delete the existing prompt template and add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt.


Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor.  Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. {{ <tool-name>(key) }}.
Enter the key as an input
In the input area set the value to helpful-assistant. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your key.
Press the Run button
Start the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.


Change the key to grumpy-assistant.


If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to
first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
Play with the LLM
Ask the LLM, I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'. You should see a grumpy response from "Freddy" now.
If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant-personalities("grumpy-assistant") }}. Delete the grumpy-assistant field and add it into your chat template.
Save your Prompt.
If you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.


The Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the model configs when you update them, as long as the key is the same.


Since the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing
the values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools could affect the relative
propmt's behaviour that won't be captured by the Prompt's version. This could
be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the
changes are expected.",

Navigate to the Editor of your Prompt
Copy and paste the following text into the Prompt template box:
On the right hand side under Completions, enter the following three examples of topics: Google, Physics and Exercise.
Press the Run all button bottom right (or use the keyboard shortcut Command + Enter).
On the right hand side the results from calling the Pinecone tool for the specific topic will be shown highlighted in purple and the final summary provided by the LLM that uses these results will be highlighted in green.




Each active tool in your organisation will have a unique signature that you can use to specify the tool within a prompt template.
You can find the signature in the pink box on each tool card on the Tools page.
You can also use double curly brackets - {{ - within the prompt template in the Prompt Editor to see a dropdown of available tools.
In the case of Pinecone tools, the signature takes two positional arguments: query(the query text passed to Pinecone) and top_k(the number of similar chunks to retrieve from Pinecone for the query).",

can reference the OpenAI
guidelines:
The more training examples you have, the better. We recommend having at least a couple hundred examples. In general, we've found that each doubling of the dataset size leads to a linear increase in model quality.",

Go to your Humanloop project and navigate to Logs tab.
Create a filter
Using the + Filter button above the table of the logs you would like to fine-tune on.
For example, all the logs that have received a positive upvote in the feedback captured from your end users.


Click the Actions button, then click the New fine-tuned model button to set up the finetuning process.
Enter the appropriate parameters for the fine-tuned model.
Enter a Model name. This will be used as the suffix parameter in OpenAI’s fine-tune interface. For example, a suffix of "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like ada:ft-your-org:custom-model-name-2022-02-15-04-21-04.

Choose the Base model to fine-tune. This can be ada, babbage, curie, or davinci.

Select a Validation split percentage. This is the proportion of data that will be used for validation. Metrics will be periodically calculated against the validation data during training.

Enter a Data snapshot name. Humanloop associates a data snapshot to every fine-tuned model instance so it is easy to keep track of what data is used (you can see yourexisting data snapshots on the Settings/Data snapshots page)




Click Create
The fine-tuning process runs asynchronously and may take up to a couple of hours to complete depending on your data snapshot size.
See the progress
Navigate to the Fine-tuning tab to see the progress of the fine-tuning process.

all the parameters to the model such as temperature, max_tokens, top_p etc.

any tools available to the model


A Prompt is callable in that if you supply the necessary inputs, it will return a response from the model.
Inputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. {{topic}} and the value of the variable will need to be supplied when you call the Prompt to create a generation.
This separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different configurations and evaluate any changes. The Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data are stored in Logs, which can then be re-used in Datasets.


FYI: Prompts have recently been renamed from 'Projects'. The Project's "Model
Configs" are now just each version of a Prompt. Some of the documentation and
APIs may still refer to Projects and Model Configs.


Note that we use a capitalized "Prompt" to refer to the
entity in Humanloop, and a lowercase "prompt" to refer to the general concept
of input to the model.",

Target: data representing the expected or intended output of the model.

A test dataset is a collection of datapoints, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming. Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.
When you run an offline evaluation, Humanloop iterates through each datapoint in the dataset and triggers a fresh LLM generation using the inputs of the testcase and the model config being evaluated. For each test case, your evaluator function will be called, taking as arguments the freshly generated log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it.

Model Provider is where the model is from. For example, ‘OpenAI’, or ‘AI21’ etc.
Model refers to the actual AI model that should be used. Such as text-davinci-002 (large, relatively expensive, highly capable model trained to follow instructions) babbage (smaller, cheaper, faster but worse at creative tasks), or gpt-j (an open source model – coming soon!).
Fine-tuned model - finetuning takes one of the existing models and specialises it for a specific task by further training it with some task-specific data.
Finetuning lets you get more out of the models by providing:
Higher quality results than prompt design

Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt

Token savings due to shorter prompts

See our cookbook tutorial for examples on how to use Flows in your code.

What's next
We'll soon be extending support for allowing Evaluators to access all Logs inside a trace.
Additionally, we will build on this by adding UI-first visualisations and management of your Flows.

    "content": "Human Evaluator upgrades
We've made significant upgrades to Human Evaluators and related workflows to improve your ability to gather Human judgments (sometimes referred to as "feedback") in assessing the quality of your AI applications.
Here are some of the key improvements:
Instead of having to define a limited feedback schema tied to the settings of a specific Prompt, you can now define your schema with a Human Evaluator file and reuse it across multiple Prompts and Tools for both monitoring and offline evaluation purposes.

You are no longer restricted to the default types of Rating, Actions and Issues when defining your feedback schemas from the UI. We've introduced a more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types and valence controls.

We've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now also be used with Tools and other Evaluators (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.

We've improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.


To set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on Evaluator, then click on Human.
This will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a Return type for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.
Tone evaluator set up with options and instructions
You can then reference this Human Evaluator within the Monitoring dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their Evaluations tab.
We've set up default Rating and Correction Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing. We've migrated all your existing Prompt specific feedback schemas to Human Evaluator files and these will continue to work as before with no disruption.
Check out our updated document for further details on how to use Human Evaluators:

We've made improvements to help you evaluate the components of your AI applications, quickly see issues and explore the full context of each evaluation.
A clearer Evaluation tab in Logs
We've given the Log drawer's Evaluation tab a facelift. You can now clearly see what the results are for each of the connected Evaluators.
This means that it's now easier to debug the judgments applied to a Log, and if necessary, re-run code/AI Evaluators in-line.

Ability to re-run Evaluators
We have introduced the ability to re-run your Evaluators against a specific Log. This feature allows you to more easily address and fix issues with previous Evaluator judgments for specific Logs.
You can request a re-run of that Evaluator by opening the menu next to that Evaluator and pressing the "Run Again" option.
Evaluation popover
If you hover over an evaluation result, you'll now see a popover with more details about the evaluation including any intermediate results or console logs without context switching.

Updated Evaluator Logs table

Tool Calling: When defining a tool as part of your Prompt definition, you can now include a strict=true flag. The model will then output JSON data that adheres to the tool parameters schema definition.


Response Format: We have expanded the response_format with option json_schema and a request parameter to also include an optional json_schema field where you can pass in the schema you wish the model to adhere to.


This new response formant functionality is only supported by the latest OpenAPI model snapshots gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.
We will also be exposing this functionality in our Editor UI soon too!",

We've released Evaluation reports, which allows you to easily compare the performance of your different Prompts or Tools across multiple different Evaluator criteria.
This generalises our previous concept of Evaluation runs, extending it with multiple complimentary changes with getting more from your evals. All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.


Feature breakdown
We've introduced a new stats comparison view, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.
The performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.
Evaluation reports also introduce an automatic deduplication feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a New Batch in the setup panel.


How to use Evaluation reports
To get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click Evaluate in the top right.
This will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.

When you click Save, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.
What's next
We're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations.",

It also means you get the full power of our file versioning system, allowing you track and commit every change you make Datasets and their Datapoints, with attribution and commit messages inspired by Git.


It's now easy to understand which version of a Dataset was used in a given Evaluation run, and whether the most recent edits to the Dataset were included or not.

Introducing same day support for the Claude 3 - Anthropics new industry leading models. Read more about the release here.
The release contains three models in ascending order of capability: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. This suite provides users with the different options to balance intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific use-cases.


Key take aways
Performance - a new leader. The largest of the 3 models, Opus, is claimed to outperform GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on key benchmarks such as MMLU and Hellaswag. It even reached 84.9% on the Humaneval coding test set (vs GPT-4’s 67%) 🤯

200k context window with near-perfect recall on selected benchmarks. Opus reports 99% accuracy on the NIAH test, which measures how accurately a model can recall information given to it in a large corpus of data.

Opus has vision. Anthropic claim that performance here is on par with that of other leading models (ie GPT-4 and Gemini). They say it’s most useful for inputting graphs, slides etc. in an enterprise setting.

Pricing - as compared to OpenAI:


Opus - 75 (2.5x GPT-4 Turbo)  
Sonnet - 15 (50% of GPT-4 Turbo)

Haiku - $1.25 (1.6x GPT-3.5)
How you can use it: The Claude 3 family is now available on Humanloop. Bring your API key to test, evaluate and deploy the publicly available models - Opus and Sonnet.",

You can now create Tools in the same way as you create Prompts and Directories. This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.

To create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.
Tool editor and deployments
You can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.

Tool Editor
This replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.

Deployment
Tools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.
And example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature snippet(key) with a key/value pair of "helpful"/"You are a helpful assistant". You decide you would rather change the value to say "You are a funny assistant", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.
Prompt labels and hover cards
We've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.


The labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.
You'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.


As a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.


Committing Prompt Versions
Building on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.
This is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.
In addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use commits that can take commit messages, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.
We've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.


We'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.

Datapoints are color-coded by the dataset used for the run.
The table is now paginated and does not load your entire project's list of evaluation runs in a single page load. The page should therefore load faster for teams with a large number of runs.

We've added a save flag to all of our endpoints that generate logs on Humanloop so that you can control whether the request and response payloads that may contain sensitive information are persisted on our servers or not.
If save is set to false then no inputs, messages our outputs of any kind (including the raw provider request and responses) are stored on our servers. This can be helpful for sensitive use cases where you can't for example risk PII leaving your system.
Details of the model configuration and any metadata you send are still stored. Therefore you can still benefit from certain types of evaluators such as human feedback, latency and cost, as well as still track important metadata over time that may not contain sensitive information.
This includes all our chat and completion endpoint variations, as well as our explicit log endpoint.
Logging provider request
We're now capturing the raw provider request body alongside the existing provider response for all logs generated from our deployed endpoints.
This provides more transparency into how we map our provider agnostic requests to specific providers. It can also effective for helping to troubleshoot the cases where we return well handled provider errors from our API.",

    "content": "Add Evaluators to existing runs
You can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.


Improved Evaluation Debug Console
We've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.

On any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.
After clicking Run to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.

LLM Evaluators
We expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.
After clicking Run on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the LLM Evaluation Log column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.

This is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.

Tool projects
We have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config in the Editor as well as tools managed at organization level.
It is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.

Tool versioning
In the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.
Logs
Any logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our sessions guide and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session
Offline Evaluations via SDK
You can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the Set up evaluations using API guide.
Support for new OpenAI Models
Following OpenAI's latest model releases, you will find support for all the latest models in our Playground and Editor.
GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo
If your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release gpt-4-0125-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.

We also support the new gpt-4-turbo-preview model alias, which points to the latest gpt-4-turbo model without specifying a specific version.
Embedding Models
Finally, the new embedding models - text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are also available for use via Humanloop. The small model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation ada-002 embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space.",

Cancellable evaluation runs
Occasionally, you may launch an evaluation run and then realise that you didn't configure it quite the way you wanted. Perhaps you want to use a different model config or dataset, or would like to halt its progress for some other reason.

We've started the year by enhancing our evaluations API to give you more flexibility for self-hosting whichever aspects of the evaluation workflow you need to run in your own infrastructure - while leaving the rest to us!
Mixing and matching the Humanloop-runtime with self-hosting
Conceptually, evaluation runs have two components:
Generation of logs for the datapoints using the version of the model you are evaluating.

Evaluating those logs using Evaluators.


Now, using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted (see our guide on external generations for evaluations).
Similarly, evaluating of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app), or self-hosted (see our guide on self-hosted evaluations).
It is now possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime logs and evaluations in any combination you wish.
When creating an Evaluation (via the improved UI dialogue or via the API), you can set the new hl_generated flag to False to indicate that you are posting the logs from your own infrastructure. You can then also include an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.


You can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators.",

    "content": "Human Evaluators
We've introduced a new special type of 'Human' Evaluator to compliment our existing code and AI based Evaluators.
There are many important evaluation use cases that require input from your internal domain experts, or product teams. Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.


Our new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.
Once completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.


Set up your first Human Evaluator run by following our guide.
Return inputs flag
We've introduced a return_inputs flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.
As context model windows get increasingly larger, for example Claude with 200k tokens, it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.
When you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the inputs that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.
As always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.
Gemini
You can now use Google's latest LLMs, Gemini, in Humanloop.
Setup
To use Gemini, first go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey and generate an API key. Then, save this under the "Google" provider on your API keys page.
Head over to the playground, and you should see gemini-pro and gemini-pro-vision in your list of models.


You can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's /chatendpoints.
Features
Gemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.
However, note that while gemini-pro supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, gemini-pro-vision supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to Gemini's docs for more details.
When providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL.",

Prompt diffs
Following our recent introduction of our .prompt file, you can now compare your model configs within a project with our new 'diff' view.

It's now possible to manage tool definitions globally for your organization and re-use them across multiple projects by linking them to your model configs.
Prior to this change, if you wanted to re-use the same tool definition across multiple model configs, you had to copy and paste the JSON schema snippet defining the name, description and parameters into your Editor for each case. And if you wanted to make changes to this tool, you would have to recall which model configs it was saved to prior and update them inline 1 by 1.
You can achieve this tool re-use by first defining an instance of our new JsonSchema tool available as another option in your global Tools tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit'), and then link that to as many model configs as you need within the Editor as shown below.
Importantly, updates to the get_current_weather JsonSchema tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the model configs you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the prompt.
The old behaviour of defining the tool inline as part of your model config definition is still available for the cases where you do want changes in the definition of the tool to lead to new versions of the model-config.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the JsonSchema tool card.

With the dialog open, define your tool with name, description, and parameters values. Our guide for using OpenAI Function Calling in the playground can be a useful reference in this case.

Introducing .prompt files
We're introducing a .prompt file format for representing model configs in a format that's both human-readable and easy to work with.
For certain use cases it can be helpful for engineers to also store their prompts alongside their app's source code in their favourite version control system. The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.
These .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.
Exporting via API
To fetch a .prompt file via the API, make POST request to https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export, where {id} is the ID of the model config (beginning with config_).
Export from Humanloop
You can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click Export .prompt. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).


Editor
Additionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press Cmd-Shift-E when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.


More details on our .prompt file format are available here. We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned.",

    "content": "Improved RBACs
We've introduced more levels to our roles based access controls (RBACs).
We now distinguish between different roles to help you better manage your organization's access levels and permissions on Humanloop.
This is the first in a sequence of upgrades we are making around RBACs.
Organization roles
Everyone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).
A user can be one of the following rolws:
**Admin:**The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.
Developer:(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.
Member:(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.
RBACs summary
Here is the full breakdown of roles and access:
Action Member Developer Admin 
Create and manage Prompts ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Inspect logs and feedback ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage evaluators ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Run evaluations ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage datasets ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage API keys  ✔️ ✔️ 
Manage prompt deployments  ✔️ ✔️ 
Create and manage environments  ✔️ ✔️ 
Send invites   ✔️ 
Set user roles   ✔️ 
Manage billing   ✔️ 
Change organization settings   ✔️ 

Self hosted evaluations
We've added support for managing evaluations outside of Humanloop in your own code.
There are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.
For example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or LLM evaluator within your Humanloop project.
With this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.
To better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:
Retrieve your curated datasets

Trigger evaluation runs

Send evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators


Below is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our guide on self-hosted evaluations.
Chat response
We've updated the response models of all of our /chat API endpoints to include an output message object.
Up to this point, our chat and completion endpoints had a unified response model, where the content of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common output field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate tool_calls field.
When making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an output_message field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.
Before:
After:
Snippet tool
We've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.
This functionality is provided by our new Snippet tool. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.
For example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.
Before now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.

When the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.


You can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.
The name field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as assistant below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax {{ assistant(key) }}.
The key is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.
The value is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.

Use the tool
Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.

The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our editor environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.
Above we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the {{ <your-tool-name>(key) }} so in this case it would be {{ assistant(key) }}. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your key, in the screenshot above we used the helpful key to access the You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.


If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant("helpful") }}.

This is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.

No more accidental blank messages
We've also fixed issues where empty messages would get appended to the chat.
We've improved keyboard navigation

We've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.
With the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as parallel tool calling.
Editor updates
You can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:
Select one of the new turbo models in the model dropdown.

Specify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.

Make a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.

As shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message




API implications
We've added an additional field tool_calls to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing tool_call parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.
Each element in the tool_calls array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the tool_call_id must be provided, along with role=tool and the content containing the tool response.
Python SDK improvements
We've improved the response models of our Python SDK and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.
Improved response model types
As of versions >= 0.6.0, our Python SDK methods now return Pydantic models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.
Previously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:


With Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from < 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the Raw HTTP Response section.


🚧 Breaking change
Moving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.

Support for timeout parameter
The default timeout used by aiohttp, which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.
In the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passingtimeout=1000 will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.
Multi-modal models
We've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!
We've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V). You can now select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.
Let us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!
Editor quick start
To get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.
Select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown.

Click the Add images button within a user's chat message.

To add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select "Upload image" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.

Note that you can add multiple images




To view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.


API quick start
Assuming you have deployed your gpt-4-vision-preview based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.
Any generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.
Limitations
There are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:
Image messages are only supported by the gpt-4-vision-preview model in chat mode.

GPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.

You cannot add images to the first system message.


JSON mode and seed parameters
We've introduced new model config parameters for JSON mode and Seed in our Editor and API.
With the introduction of the new OpenAI turbo models you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; response_format and seed.



See further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format here and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter here.
These new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for response_format or seed will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.




When using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.
In fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.",

Until now, it's been possible to trigger LLM-based evaluations by writing Python code that uses the Humanloop API to trigger the LLM generations.
Today, in order to make this increasingly important workflow simpler and more intuitive, we're releasing LLM Evaluators, which require no Python configuration.
From the Evaluations page, click New Evaluator and select LLM Evaluator.


Instead of a code editor, the right hand side of the page is now a prompt editor for defining instructions to the LLM Evaluator. Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.


In the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual {{ variable }} syntax, and include:
log_inputs - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated

log_prompt - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)

log_messages - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)

log_output - the output produced by the model

log_error - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced

testcase - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.


Take a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.


At the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.
Since an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.
Improved evaluator editor
Given our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.

In the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:
Select the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs

Select the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number


Underneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets.",

We've updated our evaluation runs with a table to help view the outcomes of runs in a more condensed form. It also allows you to sort results and trigger re-runs easier. As new evaluators are included, a column will be added automatically to the table.

Re-run previous evaluations
We've exposed the re-run option in the table to allow you to quickly trigger runs again, or use older runs as a way to preload the dialog and change the parameters such as the target dataset or model config.

We recently released Datasets in our Evaluations beta, by the name Evaluation Testsets. We're now promoting the concept to a first-class citizen within your projects. If you've previously been using testsets in the evaluations beta, you'll see that your testsets have now automatically migrated to datasets.
Datasets can be created via CSV upload, converting from existing Logs in your project, or by API requests.
See our guides on datasets, which show how to upload from CSV and perform a batch generation across the whole dataset.


Clicking into a dataset, you can explore its datapoints.


A dataset contains a collection of prompt variable inputs (the dynamic values which are interpolated into your model config prompt template at generation-time), as well as a collection of messages forming the chat history, and a target output with data representing what we expect the model to produce when it runs on those inputs.
Datasets are useful for evaluating the behaviour of you model configs across a well-defined collection of test cases. You can use datasets to check for regressions as you iterate your model configs, knowing that you are checking behaviour against a deterministic collection of known important examples.
Datasets can also be used as collections of input data for fine-tuning jobs.",

We've added support for a tool that can make GET calls to an external API.
This can be used to dynamically retrieve context for your prompts. For example, you may wish to get additional information about a user from your system based on their ID, or look up additional information based on a query from a user.
To set up the tool you need to provide the following details for your API:
Tool parameter Description Example 
Name A unique tool name to reference as a call signature in your prompts get_api_tool 
URL The URL for your API endpoint https://your-api.your-domain.com 
API Key Header The authentication header required by your endpoint. X-API-KEY 
API Key The API key value to use in the authentication header. sk_1234567891011121314 
Query parameters A comma delimited list of the query parameters to set when making requests. user_query, client_id 

Define your API
First you will need to define your API. For demo purposes, we will create a mock endpoint in postman. Our mock endpoint simply returns details about a mock user given their user_id.
A call to our Mock API in Python is as follows; note the query parameter user_id
And returns the response:
We can now use this tool to inject information for a given user into our prompts.
Set up the tool
Navigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Get API Call  tool card:


Configure the tool with your API details:


Use the tool
Now your API tool is set up, you can use it to populate input variables in your prompt templates. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. The call signature is the unique tool name with arguments for the query parameters defined when the tool was set up.
In our mock example, the signature will be:  get_user_api(user_id).
An example prompt template using this tool is:
The tool requires an input value to be provided for user_id. In our playground environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat:

Offline evaluators provide the ability to test your prompt engineering efforts rigorously in development and CI. Offline evaluators test the performance of your model configs against a pre-defined suite of testcases - much like unit testing in traditional programming.
With this framework, you can use test-driven development practices to iterate and improve your model configs, while monitoring for regressions in CI.

We've unified how errors returned by model providers are handled and enabled error monitoring using eval functions.
A common production pain point we see is that hosted SOTA language models can still be flaky at times, especially at real scale. With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.
Unified errors
Our users integrate the Humanloop /chat and /completion API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.
Errors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of error response codes.
We've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for type, message, code and origin. The origin field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.
For example, for our /chat  endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for max_tokens, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.
Monitor model reliability with evals
With this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within evaluation functions.
You can now turn on the Errors eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project. Or you can customise this template to track more specific error behaviour.",

We've added support for OpenAI functions to our playground!
This builds on our API support and allows you to easily experiment with OpenAI functions within our playground UI.
OpenAI functions are implemented as tools on Humanloop. Tools follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions. You can now define tools as part of your model configuration in the playground. These tools are sent as OpenAI functions when running the OpenAI chat models that support function calling.
The model can choose to return a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call a function. This object is displayed as a special assistant message within the playground. You can then provide the result of the call in a message back to the model to consider, which simulates the function calling workflow.
Use tools in Playground
Take the following steps to use tools for function calling in the playground:
Find tools: Navigate to the playground and locate the Tools section. This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.



Create a new tool: Click on the "Add Tool" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the json-schema syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.



Edit a tool: To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition. This will result in a new model configuration.



Run a model with tools: Once you've defined your tools, you can run the model by pressing the "Run" button.
If the model chooses to call a function, an assistant message will be displayed with the corresponding tool name and arguments to use.

A subsequent Tool message is then displayed to simulate sending the results of the call back to the model to consider.





Save your model config with tools by using the Save button. Model configs with tools defined can then deployed to environments as normal.


Coming soon
Provide the runtime for your tool under the existing pre-defined Tools section  of your organization on Humanloop.",

    "content": "Evaluators
We've added Evaluators to Humanloop in beta!
Evaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the Data tab.
We're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!
Create an Evaluator
If you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new Evaluations tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select + New Evaluator. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.


We'll pick Valid JSON for this guide.


In the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a datapoint argument and should return a value of the chosen type.
Currently, the available return types for an Evaluators are number and boolean. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.
The Datapoint argument
The datapoint passed into your function will be a Python dict with the following structure.
To inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click Random selection in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.


For this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple json.loads call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return False.
Debugging
Once you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.


If your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.
Once you're happy with your Evaluator, click Create in the bottom left of the dialog.
Activate / Deactivate an Evaluator
Your Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the Evaluations tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.
Each Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator on, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to that project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).
You can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.
Aggregations and Graphs
At the top of the Dashboard tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.
At the bottom of the Dashboard tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.


Aggregation
For the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:
Boolean: percentage returning True of the total number of evaluated datapoints

Number: average value across all evaluated datapoints


Data logs
In the Data tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.


From this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose Run evals from the Actions menu in the top right.
Available Modules
The following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:
math

random

datetime

json (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)

jsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)

sqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)

requests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).

Adding a datapoint to a session

For example, using uuid4() to generate this ID,
Similarly, our other methods such as humanloop.complete_deployed(), humanloop.chat(), and humanloop.log() etc. support session_reference_id.

    "content": "Introducing Tools
Today we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.
Tools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.
Read more on our blog and see an example of setting up a tool for semantic search.
OpenAI functions API
We've updated our APIs to support OpenAI function calling.
OpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our chat and log endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.
This unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.
Recap on OpenAI functions
As described in the OpenAI documentation, the basic steps for using functions are:
Call one of the models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal json-schema syntax.

The model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.

You can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (NB: the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).

Finally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.


OpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a get_current_weather function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:
Using with Humanloop tools
OpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.
We've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.
In the cases of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.
You can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:
Chat endpoint
We show here how to update the run_conversation() method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:
After running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:

Log endpoint
Alternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:

    "content": "Deployment environments
We've added support for environments to your deployments in Humanloop!
This enables you to deploy your model configurations to specific environments. You'll no longer have to duplicate your projects to manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you'll have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.
Enabling environments for your organisation
Every organisation automatically receives a default production environment. For any of your existing projects that had active deployments define, these have been automatically migrated over to use the default environment with no change in behaviour for the APIs.
You can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's environments page.
Creating an environment
Enter a custom name in the create environment dialog. Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.

The environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.

The default environment
By default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the "Active Deployment," such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed will use this environment.


Renaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.
Using environments
Once created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.
You can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the Deployments section.

Alternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.
Using environments via API

For v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed, you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional environment field.
You can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the "Use API" option.
Clicking on the "Use API" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the environment variable in practice.",

OpenAI Azure support
We've just added support for Azure deployments of OpenAI models to Humanloop!
This update adds the ability to target Microsoft Azure deployments of OpenAI models to the playground and your projects. To set this up, visit your organization's settings.
Enabling Azure OpenAI for your organization
As a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the Azure OpenAI docs for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.

Click the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.
Your endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.
Your API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.
Working with Azure OpenAI models
Once you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.


REST API and Python / TypeScript support
As with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.
In the model_config.model field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).
The request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the provider_api_keys field, as shown in the example above.
Note: Naming Model Deployments
When you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of gpt-35-turbo in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like my-orgs-llm-model.
In order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like gpt-35-turbo, or the base model name with a custom prefix like my-org-gpt-35-turbo. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting max_tokens=-1 in your model configs fail to work as expected.",

The client initialization step of hl.init(...) is now humanloop = Humanloop(...).
Previously provider_api_keys could be provided in hl.init(...). They should now be provided when constructing Humanloop(...) client.




hl.generate(...)'s various call signatures have now been split into individual methods for clarity. The main ones are:

Datasets are identified by the ID or their path. The datapoints determine the versions of the Dataset.
By default, the new Dataset version will be set to the list of Datapoints provided in
the request. You can also create a new version by adding or removing Datapoints from an existing version
by specifying action as add or remove respectively. In this case, you may specify
the version_id or environment query parameters to identify the existing version to base
the new version on. If neither is provided, the default deployed version will be used.
If you provide a commit message, then the new version will be committed;
otherwise it will be uncommitted. If you try to commit an already committed version,
an exception will be raised.
Humanloop also deduplicates Datapoints. If you try to add a Datapoint that already
exists, it will be ignored. If you intentionally want to add a duplicate Datapoint,
you can add a unique identifier to the Datapoint's inputs such as {_dedupe_id: <unique ID>}.",

Datasets are identified by the ID or their path. The datapoints determine the versions of the Dataset.
By default, the new Dataset version will be set to the list of Datapoints provided in
the request. You can also create a new version by adding or removing Datapoints from an existing version
by specifying action as add or remove respectively. In this case, you may specify
the version_id or environment query parameters to identify the existing version to base
the new version on. If neither is provided, the default deployed version will be used.
If you provide a commit message, then the new version will be committed;
otherwise it will be uncommitted. If you try to commit an already committed version,
an exception will be raised.
Humanloop also deduplicates Datapoints. If you try to add a Datapoint that already
exists, it will be ignored. If you intentionally want to add a duplicate Datapoint,
you can add a unique identifier to the Datapoint's inputs such as {_dedupe_id: <unique ID>}.",
