 * The algorithm for generating the navigation is as follows:
 *
 * 1. visit all the endpoints, websockets, and webhooks in the API definition,
 *    and store them in a `map<ApiNavigationNodeLocator, Endpoint | WebSocket | Webhook>`
 * 2. visit all subpackages, and store them in a map that keeps a reference to its parent subpackage(s)
 * 3. traverse ApiNavigationConfigRootV2 and construct a first-pass of the tree structure, while also
 *    keeping track of the subpackages, endpoints, websockets, and webhooks that have been visited
 * 4. traverse the tree structure again and insert the subpackages, endpoints, websockets, and webhooks that have not been visited
