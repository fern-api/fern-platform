These limits and policies can be set at different hierarchical levels,\r\nallowing flexibility in how capacity is controlled.\n\nTime-Based Validity:\r\nIn addition to defining what a ticket allows access to, the admission must also specify when the access is valid.\r\nEvery admission needs to be linked to a specific time slot to ensure proper scheduling.\r\nIn cases where the time is not explicitly provided, the system may assign a time slot automatically (defined by setup),\r\nwhich is particularly useful for scenarios like walk-up ticket sales at kiosks,\r\nwhere tickets should be valid immediately upon purchase.\n\nDynamic Pricing:\r\nEach time slot can independently manage its pricing.\r\nWhile the base price is determined by the item number, time slots can either use a fixed price or\r\napply dynamic pricing adjustments to the base price based on demand, capacity, or other factors.\n\nTime Slot Visibility: All available time slots are displayed to the consumer, even if they are no longer\r\nallocatable (e.g., fully booked or sold out). This is intentional, as it allows the system to provide\r\nvisibility into popular events, offering a sense of urgency or exclusivity that can drive consumer interest."

Each store or sales channel may have its own unique set of memberships\r\nand the store code ensures that only the relevant subset of catalog items are returned.\r\nThis is particularly useful in cases where different platforms, regions, or partners require distinct offerings.\n\nLocalized Storefront:\r\nThe store front is typically designed to target a specific language or region.\r\nAs a result, the catalog endpoint ensures that ticket information is delivered in the appropriate language for\r\nthe store's target audience. By supporting multiple languages, the system can accommodate global users\r\nwhile ensuring that the presentation and messaging are localized.\n\nFormatted Content Fields:\r\nThe catalog also supports two fields that can include HTML styling and formatting.\r\nThese fields provide flexibility for content presentation, allowing rich text formatting such as bold text,\r\nlists, links, or other HTML elements.\r\nThis ensures that the ticket descriptions or other important information can be presented in an\r\nengaging and readable way, enhancing the user experience across different devices or platforms.\r\nIt also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions\r\nwithout requiring separate design templates for each store."
