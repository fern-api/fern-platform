    "content": "The principal way you \"program\" LLMs is through natural language instructions called prompts. There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.\nDeveloping, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:\nSubject matter experts matter more than ever. As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.\n\nAI output is often non-deterministic. Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.\n\nAI outputs are subjective. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.\n\n\n\n\nBad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch\nMany companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and engineers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets. The process is slow and error-prone, wasting engineering time and leading to long delays and feelings of uncertainty.",

In the simplest case, this can simply be a string representing the exact output you hope the model produces for the inputs and messages represented by the Datapoint.\nIn more complex cases, you can define an arbitrary JSON object for target with whatever fields are necessary to help you specify the intended behaviour."

Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.\nWhen you run an offline evaluation, a Log needs to be generated using the inputs of each Datapoint and the version of the application being evaluated. Evaluators then need to be run against each Log to provide judgements,\nwhich are then aggregated to provide an overall score for the application. Evaluators in this case take the generated Log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it as arguments.\nSee our guides on creating Datasets and running Evaluations for more details.",

For example, you may be using an LLM provider that is not directly supported by Humanloop such as a custom self-hosted model, or you may want to avoid adding Humanloop to the critical path of the LLM API calls."

This feature, akin to OpenAI's function calling, is implemented through JSON Schema tools in Humanloop. These Tools adhere to the widely-used JSON Schema syntax, providing a standardized way to define data structures.\nWithin the editor, you have the flexibility to create inline JSON Schema tools as part of your model configuration.

    "content": "To create and use a tool follow the following steps:\n\n\nOpen the editor\nGo to a Prompt and open the Editor.\nSelect a model that supports Tool Calling\n\n\nTo view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models\npage.\nIn the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose a model like gpt-4o which supports Tool Calling.\nDefine the Tool\nTo get started with tool definition, it's recommended to begin with one of our preloaded example tools. For this guide, we'll use the get_current_weather tool. Select this from the dropdown menu of preloaded examples.\nIf you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax. When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.\n\n\nTest it out\nNow, let's test our tool by inputting a relevant query. Since we're working with a weather-related tool, try typing: What's the weather in Boston?. This should prompt OpenAI to respond using the parameters we've defined.\n\n\nKeep in mind that the model's use of the tool depends on the relevance of the user's input. For instance, a question like 'how are you today?' is unlikely to trigger a weather-related tool response.\nCheck assistant response for a tool call\nUpon successful setup, the assistant should respond by invoking the tool, providing both the tool's name and the required data. For our get_current_weather tool, the response might look like this:\nInput tool response\nAfter the tool call, the editor will automatically add a partially filled tool message for you to complete.\nYou can paste in the exact response that the Tool would respond with. For prototyping purposes, you can also just simulate the repsonse yourself (LLMs can handle it!). Provide in a mock response:\nTo input the tool response:\nFind the tool response field in the editor.\n\nEnter theresponse matching the expected format, such as:\n\n\nRemember, the goal is to simulate the tool's output as if it were actually fetching real-time weather data. This allows you to test and refine your prompt and tool interaction without needing to implement the actual weather API.\nSubmit tool response\nAfter entering the simulated tool response, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to the AI model.\nReview assistant response\nThe assistant should now respond using the information provided in your simulated tool response. For example, if you input that the weather in London was drizzling at 12°C, the assistant might say:\nBased on the current weather data, it's drizzling in London with a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius.\nThis response demonstrates how the AI model incorporates the tool's output into its reply, providing a more contextual and data-driven answer.\n\n\nIterate and refine\nFeel free to experiment with different queries and simulated tool responses. This iterative process helps you fine-tune your prompt and understand how the AI model interacts with the tool, ultimately leading to more effective and accurate responses in your application.\nSave your Prompt\nBy saving your prompt, you're creating a new version that includes the tool configuration.\nCongratulations! You've successfully learned how to use tool calling in the Humanloop editor. This powerful feature allows you to simulate and test tool interactions, helping you create more dynamic and context-aware AI applications.\nKeep experimenting with different scenarios and tool responses to fully explore the capabilities of your AI model and create even more impressive applications!",

    "content": "You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our Prompt creation guide first.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is not available for the Free tier. Please contact us if you wish\nto learn more about our Enterprise plan\nTo create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:\n\n\nCreate a new Snippet Tool\n\n\nName the Tool\nName it assistant-personalities and give it a description Useful assistant personalities.\nAdd a key called \"helpful-assistant\"\nIn the initial box add helpful-assistant and give it a value of You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.\nAdd another key called \"grumpy-assistant\"\nLet's add another key-value pair, so press the Add a key/value pair button and add a new key of grumpy-assistant and give it a value of You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy..\n\n\nPress Create Tool.\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.\nNavigate to the Editor\nGo to the Editor of your previously created project.\nAdd {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt\nDelete the existing prompt template and add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt.\n\n\nDouble curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. {{ my-tool-name(key) }}.\nEnter the key as an input\nIn the input area set the value to helpful-assistant. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your key.\nPress the Run button\nStart the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.\n\n\nChange the key to grumpy-assistant.\n\n\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to\nfirst run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\nPlay with the LLM\nAsk the LLM, I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'. You should see a grumpy response from \"Freddy\" now.\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant-personalities(\"grumpy-assistant\") }}. Delete the grumpy-assistant field and add it into your chat template.\nSave your Prompt.\nIf you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.\n\n\nThe Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the Prompts when you update them, as long as the key is the same.\n\n\nSince the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing\nthe values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools can affect the Prompt's\nbehaviour in way that won't be captured by the Prompt's version.\nThis could be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the\nchanges are expected.",

Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.\nWhen you run an offline evaluation, a Log needs to be generated using the inputs of each Datapoint and the version of the application being evaluated. Evaluators then need to be run against each Log to provide judgements,\nwhich are then aggregated to provide an overall score for the application. Evaluators in this case take the generated Log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it as arguments.\nSee our guides on creating Datasets and running Evaluations for more details.",

    "content": "This guide shows how to use the Humanloop SDK to record end-user feedback on Logs.\n\n\nDifferent use-cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user interaction.\nThere are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:\nExplicit feedback: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.\n\nImplicit feedback: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).\n\nFree-form feedback: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.\n\n\nYou should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.\nFor example, a Human Evaluator with return type \"text\" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type \"multi_select\" can be used to capture user actions\nthat provide implicit feedback.\nIf you have not done so, you can follow our guide to create a Human Evaluator to set up the appropriate feedback schema."

We've introduced a more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types and valence controls.\n\nWe've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now also be used with Tools and other Evaluators (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.\n\nWe've improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.\n\n\nTo set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on Evaluator, then click on Human.\nThis will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a Return type for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.\nTone evaluator set up with options and instructions\nYou can then reference this Human Evaluator within the Monitoring dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their Evaluations tab.\nWe've set up default Rating and Correction Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing.

All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.\n\n\nFeature breakdown\nWe've introduced a new stats comparison view, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.\nThe performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.\nEvaluation reports also introduce an automatic deduplication feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a New Batch in the setup panel.\n\n\nHow to use Evaluation reports\nTo get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click Evaluate in the top right.\nThis will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.\n\nWhen you click Save, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.\nWhat's next\nWe're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations."

This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.\n\nTo create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.\nTool editor and deployments\nYou can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.\n\nTool Editor\nThis replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.\n\nDeployment\nTools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.\nAnd example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature snippet(key) with a key/value pair of \"helpful\"/\"You are a helpful assistant\". You decide you would rather change the value to say \"You are a funny assistant\", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.\nPrompt labels and hover cards\nWe've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.\n\n\nThe labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.\nYou'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.\n\n\nAs a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.\n\n\nCommitting Prompt Versions\nBuilding on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.\nThis is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.\nIn addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use commits that can take commit messages, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.\nWe've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.\n\n\nWe'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.\nLet us know if you have any questions around these changes!"

Each chart represents a single evaluator, and shows the performance of the prompt tested in that run, so you can see at a glance how the performance your prompt versions have evolved through time, and visually spot the outliers. Datapoints are color-coded by the dataset used for the run.\nThe table is now paginated and does not load your entire project's list of evaluation runs in a single page load. The page should therefore load faster for teams with a large number of runs.\nThe columns in the table are now filterable and sortable, allowing you to - for example - filter just for the completed runs which test two specific prompt versions on a specific datasets, sorted by their performance under a particular evaluator."

    "content": "Add Evaluators to existing runs\nYou can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.\n\n\nImproved Evaluation Debug Console\nWe've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.\n\nOn any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.\nAfter clicking Run to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.\n\nLLM Evaluators\nWe expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.\nAfter clicking Run on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the LLM Evaluation Log column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.\n\nThis is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.\n\nTool projects\nWe have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config in the Editor as well as tools managed at organization level.\nIt is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.\n\nTool versioning\nIn the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.\nLogs\nAny logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our sessions guide and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session\nOffline Evaluations via SDK\nYou can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the Set up evaluations using API guide.\nSupport for new OpenAI Models\nFollowing OpenAI's latest model releases, you will find support for all the latest models in our Playground and Editor.\nGPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo\nIf your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release gpt-4-0125-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.\n\nWe also support the new gpt-4-turbo-preview model alias, which points to the latest gpt-4-turbo model without specifying a specific version.\nEmbedding Models\nFinally, the new embedding models - text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are also available for use via Humanloop. The small model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation ada-002 embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space."

Perhaps you want to use a different model config or dataset, or would like to halt its progress for some other reason.\nWe've now made evaluation runs cancellable from the UI - see the screenshot below.

You can then also include an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.\n\n\nYou can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators."

It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.\n\n\nSet up your first Human Evaluator run by following our guide.\nReturn inputs flag\nWe've introduced a return_inputs flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.\nAs context model windows get increasingly larger, for example Claude with 200k tokens, it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.\nWhen you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the inputs that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.\nAs always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.\nGemini\nYou can now use Google's latest LLMs, Gemini, in Humanloop.\nSetup\nTo use Gemini, first go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey and generate an API key. Then, save this under the \"Google\" provider on your API keys page.\nHead over to the playground, and you should see gemini-pro and gemini-pro-vision in your list of models.\n\n\nYou can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's /chatendpoints.\nFeatures\nGemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.\nHowever, note that while gemini-pro supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, gemini-pro-vision supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to Gemini's docs for more details.\nWhen providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL."

The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.\nThese .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.\nExporting via API\nTo fetch a .prompt file via the API, make POST request to https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export, where {id} is the ID of the model config (beginning with config_).\nExport from Humanloop\nYou can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click Export .prompt. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).\n\n\nEditor\nAdditionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press Cmd-Shift-E when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.\n\n\nMore details on our .prompt file format are available here. We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned."

    "content": "Improved RBACs\nWe've introduced more levels to our roles based access controls (RBACs).\nWe now distinguish between different roles to help you better manage your organization's access levels and permissions on Humanloop.\nThis is the first in a sequence of upgrades we are making around RBACs.\nOrganization roles\nEveryone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).\nA user can be one of the following rolws:\n**Admin:**The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.\nDeveloper:(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.\nMember:(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.\nRBACs summary\nHere is the full breakdown of roles and access:\nAction Member Developer Admin \nCreate and manage Prompts ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nInspect logs and feedback ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage evaluators ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nRun evaluations ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage datasets ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage API keys  ✔️ ✔️ \nManage prompt deployments  ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage environments  ✔️ ✔️ \nSend invites   ✔️ \nSet user roles   ✔️ \nManage billing   ✔️ \nChange organization settings   ✔️ \n\nSelf hosted evaluations\nWe've added support for managing evaluations outside of Humanloop in your own code.\nThere are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.\nFor example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or LLM evaluator within your Humanloop project.\nWith this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.\nTo better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:\nRetrieve your curated datasets\n\nTrigger evaluation runs\n\nSend evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators\n\n\nBelow is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our guide on self-hosted evaluations.\nChat response\nWe've updated the response models of all of our /chat API endpoints to include an output message object.\nUp to this point, our chat and completion endpoints had a unified response model, where the content of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common output field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate tool_calls field.\nWhen making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an output_message field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nSnippet tool\nWe've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.\nThis functionality is provided by our new Snippet tool. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\nBefore now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.\nSet up the tool\nNavigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.\n\nWhen the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.\n\n\nYou can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.\nThe name field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as assistant below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax {{ assistant(key) }}.\nThe key is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.\nThe value is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.\n\nUse the tool\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.\n\nThe tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our editor environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.\nAbove we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the {{ <your-tool-name>(key) }} so in this case it would be {{ assistant(key) }}. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your key, in the screenshot above we used the helpful key to access the You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.\n\n\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant(\"helpful\") }}.\n\nThis is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.\nWhat's next\nExplore our other tools such as the Google or Pinecone Search. If you have other ideas for helpful integrations please reach out and let us know.",

    "content": "Parallel tool calling\nWe've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.\nWith the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as parallel tool calling.\nEditor updates\nYou can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:\nSelect one of the new turbo models in the model dropdown.\n\nSpecify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.\n\nMake a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.\n\nAs shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message\n\n\n\n\nAPI implications\nWe've added an additional field tool_calls to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing tool_call parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.\nEach element in the tool_calls array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the tool_call_id must be provided, along with role=tool and the content containing the tool response.\nPython SDK improvements\nWe've improved the response models of our Python SDK and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.\nImproved response model types\nAs of versions >= 0.6.0, our Python SDK methods now return Pydantic models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.\nPreviously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:\n\n\nWith Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from < 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the Raw HTTP Response section.\n\n\n🚧 Breaking change\nMoving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.\n\nSupport for timeout parameter\nThe default timeout used by aiohttp, which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.\nIn the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passingtimeout=1000 will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.\nMulti-modal models\nWe've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!\nWe've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V). You can now select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.\nLet us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!\nEditor quick start\nTo get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.\nSelect gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown.\n\nClick the Add images button within a user's chat message.\n\nTo add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select \"Upload image\" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.\n\nNote that you can add multiple images\n\n\n\n\nTo view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.\n\n\nAPI quick start\nAssuming you have deployed your gpt-4-vision-preview based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.\nAny generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.\nLimitations\nThere are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:\nImage messages are only supported by the gpt-4-vision-preview model in chat mode.\n\nGPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.\n\nYou cannot add images to the first system message.\n\n\nJSON mode and seed parameters\nWe've introduced new model config parameters for JSON mode and Seed in our Editor and API.\nWith the introduction of the new OpenAI turbo models you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; response_format and seed.\n\n\n\nSee further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format here and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter here.\nThese new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for response_format or seed will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.\n\n\n\n\nWhen using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.\nIn fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.",

Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.\n\n\nIn the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual {{ variable }} syntax, and include:\nlog_inputs - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated\n\nlog_prompt - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)\n\nlog_messages - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)\n\nlog_output - the output produced by the model\n\nlog_error - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced\n\ntestcase - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.\n\n\nTake a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.\nSince an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.\nImproved evaluator editor\nGiven our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.\n\nIn the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:\nSelect the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs\n\nSelect the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number\n\n\nUnderneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets."

You can use datasets to check for regressions as you iterate your model configs, knowing that you are checking behaviour against a deterministic collection of known important examples.\nDatasets can also be used as collections of input data for fine-tuning jobs."

With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.\nUnified errors\nOur users integrate the Humanloop /chat and /completion API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.\nErrors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of error response codes.\nWe've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for type, message, code and origin. The origin field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.\nFor example, for our /chat  endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for max_tokens, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.\nMonitor model reliability with evals\nWith this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within evaluation functions.\nYou can now turn on the Errors eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project. Or you can customise this template to track more specific error behaviour.",

Tools follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions. You can now define tools as part of your model configuration in the playground. These tools are sent as OpenAI functions when running the OpenAI chat models that support function calling.\nThe model can choose to return a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call a function. This object is displayed as a special assistant message within the playground. You can then provide the result of the call in a message back to the model to consider, which simulates the function calling workflow.\nUse tools in Playground\nTake the following steps to use tools for function calling in the playground:\nFind tools: Navigate to the playground and locate the Tools section. This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.\n\n\n\nCreate a new tool: Click on the \"Add Tool\" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the json-schema syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.\n\n\n\nEdit a tool: To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition. This will result in a new model configuration.\n\n\n\nRun a model with tools: Once you've defined your tools, you can run the model by pressing the \"Run\" button.\nIf the model chooses to call a function, an assistant message will be displayed with the corresponding tool name and arguments to use.\n\nA subsequent Tool message is then displayed to simulate sending the results of the call back to the model to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your model config with tools by using the Save button. Model configs with tools defined can then deployed to environments as normal.\n\n\nComing soon\nProvide the runtime for your tool under the existing pre-defined Tools section  of your organization on Humanloop."

    "content": "Evaluators\nWe've added Evaluators to Humanloop in beta!\nEvaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the Data tab.\nWe're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!\nCreate an Evaluator\nIf you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new Evaluations tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select + New Evaluator. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.\n\n\nWe'll pick Valid JSON for this guide.\n\n\nIn the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a datapoint argument and should return a value of the chosen type.\nCurrently, the available return types for an Evaluators are number and boolean. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.\nThe Datapoint argument\nThe datapoint passed into your function will be a Python dict with the following structure.\nTo inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click Random selection in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.\n\n\nFor this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple json.loads call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return False.\nDebugging\nOnce you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.\n\n\nIf your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.\nOnce you're happy with your Evaluator, click Create in the bottom left of the dialog.\nActivate / Deactivate an Evaluator\nYour Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the Evaluations tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.\nEach Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator on, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to that project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).\nYou can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.\nAggregations and Graphs\nAt the top of the Dashboard tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.\nAt the bottom of the Dashboard tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.\n\n\nAggregation\nFor the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:\nBoolean: percentage returning True of the total number of evaluated datapoints\n\nNumber: average value across all evaluated datapoints\n\n\nData logs\nIn the Data tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.\n\n\nFrom this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose Run evals from the Actions menu in the top right.\nAvailable Modules\nThe following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:\nmath\n\nrandom\n\ndatetime\n\njson (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)\n\njsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)\n\nsqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)\n\nrequests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).\n\n\nLet us know if you would like to see more modules available.",

    "content": "Introducing Tools\nToday we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.\nTools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.\nRead more on our blog and see an example of setting up a tool for semantic search.\nOpenAI functions API\nWe've updated our APIs to support OpenAI function calling.\nOpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our chat and log endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.\nThis unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.\nRecap on OpenAI functions\nAs described in the OpenAI documentation, the basic steps for using functions are:\nCall one of the models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal json-schema syntax.\n\nThe model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.\n\nYou can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (NB: the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).\n\nFinally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.\n\n\nOpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a get_current_weather function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:\nUsing with Humanloop tools\nOpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.\nWe've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.\nIn the cases of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.\nYou can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:\nChat endpoint\nWe show here how to update the run_conversation() method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:\nAfter running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:\n\nLog endpoint\nAlternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:\nComing soon\nSupport for defining tools in the playground!"

To set this up, visit your organization's settings.\nEnabling Azure OpenAI for your organization\nAs a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the Azure OpenAI docs for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.\n\nClick the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.\nYour endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.\nYour API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.\nWorking with Azure OpenAI models\nOnce you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.\n\n\nREST API and Python / TypeScript support\nAs with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.\nIn the model_config.model field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).\nThe request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the provider_api_keys field, as shown in the example above.\nNote: Naming Model Deployments\nWhen you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of gpt-35-turbo in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like my-orgs-llm-model.\nIn order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like gpt-35-turbo, or the base model name with a custom prefix like my-org-gpt-35-turbo. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting max_tokens=-1 in your model configs fail to work as expected.",

There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.\nDeveloping, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:\nSubject matter experts matter more than ever. As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.\n\nAI output is often non-deterministic. Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.\n\nAI outputs are subjective. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.\n\n\n\n\nBad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch\nMany companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and engineers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets.

    "content": "Datasets are primarily used for evaluation purposes on Humanloop. You can think of a Dataset as a collection of testcases for your AI applications. Each testcase is represented by a Datapoint, which contains the following fields:\nInputs: a collection of prompt variable values which are interpolated into the prompt template at generation time (i.e. they replace the {{ variables }} you define in your prompt template).\n\nMessages: for chat models, as well as the prompt template, you can optionally have a history of chat messages that are fed into amodel when generating a response.\n\nTarget: certain types of test cases can benefit from comparing the out your application to an expected or desired behaviour. In the simplest case, this can simply be a string representing the exact output you hope the model produces for the inputs and messages represented by the Datapoint.\nIn more complex cases, you can define an arbitrary JSON object for target with whatever fields are necessary to help you specify the intended behaviour."

For these models, you can supply the description of functions and the model can choose to call one or more of them by providing the values to call the functions with.\nFunction calling enables the model to perform various tasks:\n1. Call external APIs: The model can translate natural language into API calls, allowing it to interact with external services and retrieve information.\n2. Take actions: The model can exhibit agentic behavior, making decisions and taking actions based on the given context.\n3. Provide structured output: The model's responses can be constrained to a specific structured format, ensuring consistency and ease of parsing in downstream applications.\n\n\nTools for function calling can be defined inline in the Prompt editor in which case they form part of the Prompt version. Alternatively, they can be pulled out in a Tool file which is then referenced in the Prompt.\nEach Tool has functional interface that can be supplied as the JSON Schema needed for function calling. Additionally, if the Tool is executable on Humanloop, the result of any tool will automatically be inserted into the response in the API and in the Editor.",

There may be scenarios that you wish to manage the LLM provider calls directly in your own code instead of relying on Humanloop.\nHumanloop provides a comprehensive platform for developing, managing, and versioning Prompts, Tools and your other artifacts of you AI systems. This explainer will show you how to create, version and manage your Prompts, Tools and other artifacts.\nYou can also use Prompts without proxying through Humanloop to the model provider and instead call the model yourself and explicitly log the results to your Prompt.",

    "content": "This guide will show you how to capture the Logs of your LLM calls into Humanloop.\nThe easiest way to log LLM generations to Humanloop is to use the Prompt.call() method (see the guide on Calling a Prompt). You will only need to supply prompt ID and the inputs needed by the prompt template, and the endpoint will handle fetching the latest template, making the LLM call and logging the result.\nHowever, there may be scenarios that you wish to manage the LLM provider calls directly in your own code instead of relying on Humanloop. For example, you may be using an LLM provider that is not directly supported by Humanloop such as a custom self-hosted model, or you may want to avoid adding Humanloop to the critical path of the LLM API calls."

This feature, akin to OpenAI's function calling, is implemented through JSON Schema tools in Humanloop.

    "content": "To create and use a tool follow the following steps:\n\n\nOpen the editor\nGo to a Prompt and open the Editor.\nSelect a model that supports Tool Calling\n\n\nTo view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models\npage.\nIn the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose a model like gpt-4o which supports Tool Calling.\nDefine the Tool\nTo get started with tool definition, it's recommended to begin with one of our preloaded example tools. For this guide, we'll use the get_current_weather tool. Select this from the dropdown menu of preloaded examples.\nIf you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax. When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.\n\n\nTest it out\nNow, let's test our tool by inputting a relevant query. Since we're working with a weather-related tool, try typing: What's the weather in Boston?. This should prompt OpenAI to respond using the parameters we've defined.\n\n\nKeep in mind that the model's use of the tool depends on the relevance of the user's input. For instance, a question like 'how are you today?' is unlikely to trigger a weather-related tool response.\nCheck assistant response for a tool call\nUpon successful setup, the assistant should respond by invoking the tool, providing both the tool's name and the required data. For our get_current_weather tool, the response might look like this:\nInput tool response\nAfter the tool call, the editor will automatically add a partially filled tool message for you to complete.\nYou can paste in the exact response that the Tool would respond with. For prototyping purposes, you can also just simulate the repsonse yourself (LLMs can handle it!). Provide in a mock response:\nTo input the tool response:\nFind the tool response field in the editor.\n\nEnter theresponse matching the expected format, such as:\n\n\nRemember, the goal is to simulate the tool's output as if it were actually fetching real-time weather data. This allows you to test and refine your prompt and tool interaction without needing to implement the actual weather API.\nSubmit tool response\nAfter entering the simulated tool response, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to the AI model.\nReview assistant response\nThe assistant should now respond using the information provided in your simulated tool response. For example, if you input that the weather in London was drizzling at 12°C, the assistant might say:\nBased on the current weather data, it's drizzling in London with a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius.\nThis response demonstrates how the AI model incorporates the tool's output into its reply, providing a more contextual and data-driven answer.\n\n\nIterate and refine\nFeel free to experiment with different queries and simulated tool responses. This iterative process helps you fine-tune your prompt and understand how the AI model interacts with the tool, ultimately leading to more effective and accurate responses in your application.\nSave your Prompt\nBy saving your prompt, you're creating a new version that includes the tool configuration.\nCongratulations! You've successfully learned how to use tool calling in the Humanloop editor. This powerful feature allows you to simulate and test tool interactions, helping you create more dynamic and context-aware AI applications.\nKeep experimenting with different scenarios and tool responses to fully explore the capabilities of your AI model and create even more impressive applications!",

You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy..\n\n\nPress Create Tool.\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.\nNavigate to the Editor\nGo to the Editor of your previously created project.\nAdd {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt\nDelete the existing prompt template and add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt.\n\n\nDouble curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. {{ my-tool-name(key) }}.\nEnter the key as an input\nIn the input area set the value to helpful-assistant.

When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your key.\nPress the Run button\nStart the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.\n\n\nChange the key to grumpy-assistant.\n\n\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to\nfirst run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\nPlay with the LLM\nAsk the LLM, I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'. You should see a grumpy response from \"Freddy\" now.\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant-personalities(\"grumpy-assistant\") }}. Delete the grumpy-assistant field and add it into your chat template.\nSave your Prompt.\nIf you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.\n\n\nThe Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the Prompts when you update them, as long as the key is the same.\n\n\nSince the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing\nthe values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools can affect the Prompt's\nbehaviour in way that won't be captured by the Prompt's version.\nThis could be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the\nchanges are expected.",

When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code. The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.\nCommit this version of the Tool\nPress the Commit button to commit this version of the Tool, and set it as the default version by deploying it.\nNavigate to the Editor of a Prompt\nSwitch to a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.\n\n\nTo view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models\npage.\nAdd Tool to the Prompt definition.\nSelect 'Link existing Tool'\nIn the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option.

Press the Save button and name your Prompt weather-model-config.\n(Optional) Update the Tool\nNow that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your Prompt, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tool in the sidebar and go to the Editor.\nUpdate the Tool\nLet's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:\nCommit and deploy the Tool\nPress the Commmmit button and then follow the steps to deloy this version of the Tool.\nYour Tool is now updated.\nTry the Prompt again\nNavigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.\nIn the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.\nCheck the response\nYou should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your Prompt.\n\n\n\n\nWhen updating your Tool, remember that the change will affect all the Prompts\nthat link to it.

Our guide for using Tool Calling in the Prompt Editor can be a useful reference in this case. We can use the get_current_weather schema in this case. Paste the following into the dialog:\nPress the Create button.\nNavigate to the Editor\nMake sure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.\n\n\nSee the Models page for a list of models that support tool calling.\nAdd Tool to the Prompt definition.\nSelect 'Link existing Tool'\nIn the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option. You should see your get_current_weather tool, click on it to link it to your editor.\n\n\nTest that the Prompt is working with the tool\nNow that your tool is linked you can start using it as you would normally use an inline tool. In the Chat section, in the User input, enter \"What is the weather in london?\"\nPress the Run button.\nYou should see the Assistant respond with the tool response and a new Tool field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in 22 into the tool response and press Run.\n\n\nThe model will respond with The current weather in London is 22 degrees.\nSave the Prompt\nYou've linked a tool to your model config, now let's save it. Press the Save button and name your model config weather-model-config.\n(Optional) Update the Tool\nNow that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your model config, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tools in the sidebar and go to the Editor.\nChange the tool.\nLet's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:\nSave the Tool\nPress the Save button, then the following Continue button to confirm.\nYour tool is now updated.\nTry the Prompt again\nNavigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.\nIn the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.\nCheck the response\nYou should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your model config.\n\n\n\n\nWhen updating your organization-level JSON Schema tools, remember that the\nchange will affect all the places you've previously linked the tool. Be\ncareful when making updates to not inadvertently change something you didn't\nintend.",

You will see the report below the setup panel populate with a progress bar and status pending as the Logs are generated on Humanloop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis guide assumes both the Prompt and Evaluator Logs are generated using the\nHumanloop runtime.

    "content": "This guide shows how to use the Humanloop SDK to record end-user feedback on Logs.\n\n\nDifferent use-cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user interaction.\nThere are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:\nExplicit feedback: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.\n\nImplicit feedback: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).\n\nFree-form feedback: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.\n\n\nYou should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.\nFor example, a Human Evaluator with return type \"text\" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type \"multi_select\" can be used to capture user actions\nthat provide implicit feedback.\nIf you have not done so, you can follow our guide to create a Human Evaluator to set up the appropriate feedback schema."

We've introduced a more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types and valence controls.\n\nWe've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now also be used with Tools and other Evaluators (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.\n\nWe've improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.\n\n\nTo set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on Evaluator, then click on Human.\nThis will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a Return type for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.\nTone evaluator set up with options and instructions\nYou can then reference this Human Evaluator within the Monitoring dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their Evaluations tab.\nWe've set up default Rating and Correction Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing. We've migrated all your existing Prompt specific feedback schemas to Human Evaluator files and these will continue to work as before with no disruption.\nCheck out our updated document for further details on how to use Human Evaluators:\nCreate a Human Evaluator\n\nCapture End User Feedback\n\nRun a Human Evaluation"

All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.\n\n\nFeature breakdown\nWe've introduced a new stats comparison view, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.\nThe performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.\nEvaluation reports also introduce an automatic deduplication feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a New Batch in the setup panel.\n\n\nHow to use Evaluation reports\nTo get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click Evaluate in the top right.\nThis will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.\n\nWhen you click Save, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.\nWhat's next\nWe're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations."

The largest of the 3 models, Opus, is claimed to outperform GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on key benchmarks such as MMLU and Hellaswag. It even reached 84.9% on the Humaneval coding test set (vs GPT-4’s 67%) 🤯\n\n200k context window with near-perfect recall on selected benchmarks. Opus reports 99% accuracy on the NIAH test, which measures how accurately a model can recall information given to it in a large corpus of data.\n\nOpus has vision. Anthropic claim that performance here is on par with that of other leading models (ie GPT-4 and Gemini). They say it’s most useful for inputting graphs, slides etc. in an enterprise setting.\n\nPricing - as compared to OpenAI:\n\n\nOpus - 75 (2.5x GPT-4 Turbo)  \nSonnet - 15 (50% of GPT-4 Turbo)\n\nHaiku - $1.25 (1.6x GPT-3.5)\nHow you can use it: The Claude 3 family is now available on Humanloop. Bring your API key to test, evaluate and deploy the publicly available models - Opus and Sonnet."

This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.\n\nTo create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.\nTool editor and deployments\nYou can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.\n\nTool Editor\nThis replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.\n\nDeployment\nTools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.\nAnd example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature snippet(key) with a key/value pair of \"helpful\"/\"You are a helpful assistant\". You decide you would rather change the value to say \"You are a funny assistant\", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.\nPrompt labels and hover cards\nWe've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.\n\n\nThe labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.\nYou'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.\n\n\nAs a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.\n\n\nCommitting Prompt Versions\nBuilding on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.\nThis is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.\nIn addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use commits that can take commit messages, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.\nWe've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.\n\n\nWe'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.\nLet us know if you have any questions around these changes!"

    "content": "Add Evaluators to existing runs\nYou can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.\n\n\nImproved Evaluation Debug Console\nWe've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.\n\nOn any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.\nAfter clicking Run to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.\n\nLLM Evaluators\nWe expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.\nAfter clicking Run on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the LLM Evaluation Log column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.\n\nThis is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.\n\nTool projects\nWe have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config in the Editor as well as tools managed at organization level.\nIt is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.\n\nTool versioning\nIn the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.\nLogs\nAny logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our sessions guide and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session\nOffline Evaluations via SDK\nYou can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the Set up evaluations using API guide.\nSupport for new OpenAI Models\nFollowing OpenAI's latest model releases, you will find support for all the latest models in our Playground and Editor.\nGPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo\nIf your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release gpt-4-0125-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.\n\nWe also support the new gpt-4-turbo-preview model alias, which points to the latest gpt-4-turbo model without specifying a specific version.\nEmbedding Models\nFinally, the new embedding models - text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are also available for use via Humanloop. The small model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation ada-002 embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space."

In particular, we now batch generations across the run - by default in groups of five, being conscious of potential rate limit errors (though this will soon be configurable).\nEach batch runs its generations concurrently, so you should see much faster completion times - especially in runs across larger datasets."

You can then also include an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.\n\n\nYou can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators."

Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.\n\n\nOur new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.\nOnce completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.\n\n\nSet up your first Human Evaluator run by following our guide.\nReturn inputs flag\nWe've introduced a return_inputs flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.\nAs context model windows get increasingly larger, for example Claude with 200k tokens, it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.\nWhen you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the inputs that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.\nAs always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.\nGemini\nYou can now use Google's latest LLMs, Gemini, in Humanloop.\nSetup\nTo use Gemini, first go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey and generate an API key. Then, save this under the \"Google\" provider on your API keys page.\nHead over to the playground, and you should see gemini-pro and gemini-pro-vision in your list of models.\n\n\nYou can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's /chatendpoints.\nFeatures\nGemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.\nHowever, note that while gemini-pro supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, gemini-pro-vision supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to Gemini's docs for more details.\nWhen providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL."

They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.\nDeveloper:(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.\nMember:(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.\nRBACs summary\nHere is the full breakdown of roles and access:\nAction Member Developer Admin \nCreate and manage Prompts ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nInspect logs and feedback ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage evaluators ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nRun evaluations ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage datasets ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage API keys  ✔️ ✔️ \nManage prompt deployments  ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage environments  ✔️ ✔️ \nSend invites   ✔️ \nSet user roles   ✔️ \nManage billing   ✔️ \nChange organization settings   ✔️ \n\nSelf hosted evaluations\nWe've added support for managing evaluations outside of Humanloop in your own code.\nThere are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.\nFor example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or LLM evaluator within your Humanloop project.\nWith this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.\nTo better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:\nRetrieve your curated datasets\n\nTrigger evaluation runs\n\nSend evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators\n\n\nBelow is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our guide on self-hosted evaluations.\nChat response\nWe've updated the response models of all of our /chat API endpoints to include an output message object.\nUp to this point, our chat and completion endpoints had a unified response model, where the content of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common output field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate tool_calls field.\nWhen making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an output_message field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nSnippet tool\nWe've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.\nThis functionality is provided by our new Snippet tool. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\nBefore now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.\nSet up the tool\nNavigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.\n\nWhen the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.\n\n\nYou can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.\nThe name field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as assistant below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax {{ assistant(key) }}.\nThe key is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.\nThe value is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.\n\nUse the tool\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.\n\nThe tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our editor environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.\nAbove we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the {{ <your-tool-name>(key) }} so in this case it would be {{ assistant(key) }}. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your key, in the screenshot above we used the helpful key to access the You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.\n\n\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant(\"helpful\") }}.\n\nThis is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.\nWhat's next\nExplore our other tools such as the Google or Pinecone Search. If you have other ideas for helpful integrations please reach out and let us know.",

    "content": "Parallel tool calling\nWe've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.\nWith the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as parallel tool calling.\nEditor updates\nYou can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:\nSelect one of the new turbo models in the model dropdown.\n\nSpecify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.\n\nMake a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.\n\nAs shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message\n\n\n\n\nAPI implications\nWe've added an additional field tool_calls to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing tool_call parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.\nEach element in the tool_calls array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the tool_call_id must be provided, along with role=tool and the content containing the tool response.\nPython SDK improvements\nWe've improved the response models of our Python SDK and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.\nImproved response model types\nAs of versions >= 0.6.0, our Python SDK methods now return Pydantic models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.\nPreviously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:\n\n\nWith Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from < 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the Raw HTTP Response section.\n\n\n🚧 Breaking change\nMoving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.\n\nSupport for timeout parameter\nThe default timeout used by aiohttp, which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.\nIn the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passingtimeout=1000 will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.\nMulti-modal models\nWe've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!\nWe've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V). You can now select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.\nLet us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!\nEditor quick start\nTo get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.\nSelect gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown.\n\nClick the Add images button within a user's chat message.\n\nTo add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select \"Upload image\" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.\n\nNote that you can add multiple images\n\n\n\n\nTo view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.\n\n\nAPI quick start\nAssuming you have deployed your gpt-4-vision-preview based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.\nAny generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.\nLimitations\nThere are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:\nImage messages are only supported by the gpt-4-vision-preview model in chat mode.\n\nGPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.\n\nYou cannot add images to the first system message.\n\n\nJSON mode and seed parameters\nWe've introduced new model config parameters for JSON mode and Seed in our Editor and API.\nWith the introduction of the new OpenAI turbo models you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; response_format and seed.\n\n\n\nSee further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format here and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter here.\nThese new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for response_format or seed will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.\n\n\n\n\nWhen using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.\nIn fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.",

Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.\n\n\nIn the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual {{ variable }} syntax, and include:\nlog_inputs - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated\n\nlog_prompt - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)\n\nlog_messages - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)\n\nlog_output - the output produced by the model\n\nlog_error - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced\n\ntestcase - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.\n\n\nTake a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.\nSince an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.\nImproved evaluator editor\nGiven our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.\n\nIn the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:\nSelect the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs\n\nSelect the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number\n\n\nUnderneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets."

With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.\nUnified errors\nOur users integrate the Humanloop /chat and /completion API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.\nErrors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of error response codes.\nWe've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for type, message, code and origin. The origin field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.\nFor example, for our /chat  endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for max_tokens, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.\nMonitor model reliability with evals\nWith this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within evaluation functions.\nYou can now turn on the Errors eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project.

This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.\n\n\n\nCreate a new tool: Click on the \"Add Tool\" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the json-schema syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.\n\n\n\nEdit a tool: To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition.

    "content": "Evaluators\nWe've added Evaluators to Humanloop in beta!\nEvaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the Data tab.\nWe're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!\nCreate an Evaluator\nIf you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new Evaluations tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select + New Evaluator. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.\n\n\nWe'll pick Valid JSON for this guide.\n\n\nIn the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a datapoint argument and should return a value of the chosen type.\nCurrently, the available return types for an Evaluators are number and boolean. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.\nThe Datapoint argument\nThe datapoint passed into your function will be a Python dict with the following structure.\nTo inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click Random selection in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.\n\n\nFor this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple json.loads call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return False.\nDebugging\nOnce you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.\n\n\nIf your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.\nOnce you're happy with your Evaluator, click Create in the bottom left of the dialog.\nActivate / Deactivate an Evaluator\nYour Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the Evaluations tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.\nEach Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator on, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to that project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).\nYou can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.\nAggregations and Graphs\nAt the top of the Dashboard tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.\nAt the bottom of the Dashboard tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.\n\n\nAggregation\nFor the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:\nBoolean: percentage returning True of the total number of evaluated datapoints\n\nNumber: average value across all evaluated datapoints\n\n\nData logs\nIn the Data tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.\n\n\nFrom this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose Run evals from the Actions menu in the top right.\nAvailable Modules\nThe following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:\nmath\n\nrandom\n\ndatetime\n\njson (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)\n\njsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)\n\nsqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)\n\nrequests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).\n\n\nLet us know if you would like to see more modules available.",

    "content": "Introducing Tools\nToday we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.\nTools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.\nRead more on our blog and see an example of setting up a tool for semantic search.\nOpenAI functions API\nWe've updated our APIs to support OpenAI function calling.\nOpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our chat and log endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.\nThis unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.\nRecap on OpenAI functions\nAs described in the OpenAI documentation, the basic steps for using functions are:\nCall one of the models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal json-schema syntax.\n\nThe model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.\n\nYou can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (NB: the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).\n\nFinally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.\n\n\nOpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a get_current_weather function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:\nUsing with Humanloop tools\nOpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.\nWe've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.\nIn the cases of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.\nYou can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:\nChat endpoint\nWe show here how to update the run_conversation() method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:\nAfter running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:\n\nLog endpoint\nAlternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:\nComing soon\nSupport for defining tools in the playground!"

You'll no longer have to duplicate your projects to manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you'll have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.\nEnabling environments for your organisation\nEvery organisation automatically receives a default production environment. For any of your existing projects that had active deployments define, these have been automatically migrated over to use the default environment with no change in behaviour for the APIs.\nYou can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's environments page.\nCreating an environment\nEnter a custom name in the create environment dialog. Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.\n\nThe environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.\n\nThe default environment\nBy default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the \"Active Deployment,\" such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed will use this environment.\n\n\nRenaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.\nUsing environments\nOnce created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.\nYou can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the Deployments section.\n\nAlternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.\nUsing environments via API\n\nFor v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed, you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional environment field.\nYou can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the \"Use API\" option.\nClicking on the \"Use API\" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the environment variable in practice."

To set this up, visit your organization's settings.\nEnabling Azure OpenAI for your organization\nAs a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the Azure OpenAI docs for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.\n\nClick the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.\nYour endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.\nYour API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.\nWorking with Azure OpenAI models\nOnce you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.\n\n\nREST API and Python / TypeScript support\nAs with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.\nIn the model_config.model field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).\nThe request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the provider_api_keys field, as shown in the example above.\nNote: Naming Model Deployments\nWhen you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of gpt-35-turbo in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like my-orgs-llm-model.\nIn order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like gpt-35-turbo, or the base model name with a custom prefix like my-org-gpt-35-turbo. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting max_tokens=-1 in your model configs fail to work as expected.",

    "content": "The principal way you \"program\" large language models is through natural language instruction called prompts. There's a plethora of techniques needed to prompt the models to work robustly, reliably and with the correct knowledge.\nDeveloping, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:\nSubject matter experts matter more than ever. As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.\n\nAI output is often non-deterministic. Innocuous changes to the prompts can cause unforeseen issues elsewhere.\n\nAI outputs are subjective. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.\n\n\n\n\nBad workflows for generative AI are costing you through wasted engineering effort and delays to launch\nMany companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and developers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets. The process is slow and error-prone, wasting engineering time and leading to long delays and feelings of uncertainty.",

Accept all the default config options in the setup wizard (which includes using TypeScript, Tailwind, and the Next.js app router). Now npm run dev to fire up the development server.\nNext npm i humanloop to install the Humanloop SDK in your project.\nEdit app/page.tsx to the following. This code stubs out the basic React components and state management we need for a chat interface.\n\n\nWe shouldn't call the Humanloop SDK from the client's browser as this would\nrequire giving out the Humanloop API key, which you should not do! Instead,\nwe'll create a simple backend API route in Next.js which can perform the\nHumanloop requests on the Node server and proxy these back to the client.\nCreate a file containing the code below at app/api/chat/route.ts. This will automatically create an API route at /api/chat. In the call to the Humanloop SDK, you'll need to pass the project name you created in step 1.\nIn this code, we're calling humanloop.chatDeployed. This function is used to target the model which is actively deployed on your project - in this case it should be the model we set up in step 1. Other related functions in the SDK reference (such as humanloop.chat) allow you to target a specific model config (rather than the actively deployed one) or even specify model config directly in the function call.\nWhen we receive a response from Humanloop, we strip out just the text of the chat response and send this back to the client via a Response object (see Next.js - Route Handler docs). The Humanloop SDK response contains much more data besides the raw text, which you can inspect by logging to the console.\nFor the above to work, you'll need to ensure that you have a .env.local file at the root of your project directory with your Humanloop API key. You can generate a Humanloop API key by clicking your name in the bottom left and selecting API keys. This environment variable will only be available on the Next.js server, not on the client (see Next.js - Environment Variables).\nNow, modify page.tsx to use a fetch request against the new API route.\nYou should now find that your application works as expected. When we send messages from the client, a GPT response appears beneath (after a delay).\n\n\nBack in your Humanloop Prompt dashboard you should see Logs being recorded as clients interact with your model.",

Currently, our Next.js API route blocks while the entire response is generated, before finally sending the whole thing back to the client browser in one go. For longer generations, this can take some time, particularly with larger models like GPT-4. Other model config settings can impact this too.\nTo provide a better user experience, we can deal with this latency by streaming tokens back to the client as they are generated and have them display eagerly on the page. The Humanloop SDK wraps the model providers' streaming functionality so that we can achieve this. Let's incorporate streaming tokens into our app next.\nEdit the API route at to look like the following. Notice that we have switched to using the humanloop.chatDeployedStream function, which offers Server Sent Event streaming as new tokens arrive from the model provider.\nNow, modify the onSend function in page.tsx to the following. This streams the response body in chunks, updating the UI each time a new chunk arrives.\nYou should now find that tokens stream onto the screen as soon as they are available.",

There may be scenarios that you wish to manage the LLM provider calls directly in your own code instead of relying on Humanloop.\nFor example, you may be using an LLM provider that currently is not directly supported by Humanloop such as Hugging Face.\nTo support using your own model provider, we provide additional humanloop.log() and humanloop.projects.get_active_config() methods in the SDK.\nIn this guide, we walk through how to use these SDK methods to log data to Humanloop and run experiments."

Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.\nWhen you run an offline evaluation, Humanloop iterates through each datapoint in the dataset and triggers a fresh LLM generation using the inputs of the testcase and the model config being evaluated. For each test case, your evaluator function will be called, taking as arguments the freshly generated log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it. Typically, you would write your evaluator to perform some domain-specific logic to determine whether the model-generated log meets your desired criteria (as specified in the datapoint 'target').",

This is generally versioned and managed like code\nusing formats like the\n.prompt file.\n\nData sources - to provide the relevant context to the model; often\nreferred to as retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

    "content": "The most common judgment return types are familiar from traditional data science\nand machine learning frameworks. From simple to more complex:\nBinary - involves a yes/no, true/false, or pass/fail judgment based on\nsome criteria.\n\nCategorical - involves more than two categories; for exampling adding an\nabstain or maybe option to a binary judgment.\n\nRanking - the relative quality of output from different samples or\nvariations of the model are being ranked from best to worst based on some\ncriteria. Preference based judgments are often used in evaluating the quality\nof a ranking.\n\nNumerical - involves a score, a percentage, or any other kind of numeric\nrating.\n\nText - a simple comment or a more detailed critique. Often used when a\nmore nuanced or detailed evaluation of the model's output is required.\n\nMulti-task - combines multiple types of judgment simultaneously. For\nexample, a model's output could be evaluated using both a binary rating and a\nfree-form text explanation.\n\n\nSimple individual judgments can be easily aggregated across a dataset of\nmultiple examples using well known metrics. For example, for classification\nproblems, precision,\nrecall and\nF1 are typical choices. For rankings,\nthere are metrics like\nNDCG,\nElo ratings and\nKendall's Tau.\nFor numerical judgments there are variations of the\nBleu score.\nI find that in practice binary and categorical types generally cover the\nmajority of use cases.

The more complex the judgment type, the more\npotential for ambiguity there is and the harder it becomes to make inferences.",

    "content": "Sourcing judgments is an area where there are new and evolving patterns around\nfoundation models like LLMs. At Humanloop, we've standardised around the\nfollowing canonical sources:\nHeuristic/Code - using simple deterministic rules based judgments against\nattributes like cost, token usage, latency, regex rules on the output, etc.\nThese are generally fast and cheap to run at scale.\n\nModel (or 'AI') - using other foundation models to provide judgments on\nthe output of the component. This allows for more qualitative and nuanced\njudgments for a fraction of the cost of human judgments.\n\nHuman - getting gold standard judgments from either end users of your\napplication, or internal domain experts. This can be the most expensive and\nslowest option, but also the most reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\nModel judgments in particular are increasingly promising and an active research\narea. The paper Judging LLM-as-a-Judge\ndemonstrates that an appropriately prompted GPT-4 model achieves over 80%\nagreement with human judgments when rating LLM model responses to questions on a\nscale of 1-10; that's equivalent to the levels of agreement between humans.\nSuch evaluators can be equally effective in evaluating the important non-LLM\ncomponents, such as the retrieval component in RAG. In\nAutomated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation\na GPT-3 model is tasked with extracting the most relevant sentences from the\nretrieved context. A numeric judgment for relevance is then computed using the\nratio of the number of relevant to irrelevant sentences, which was also found to\nbe highly correlated with expert human judgments.\nHowever, there are risks to consider. The same reasons that evaluating LLMs is\nhard apply to using them as evaluators. Recent research has also shown LLMs to\nhave biases that can contaminate the evaluation process. In\nBenchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators\nthey measure 6 cognitive biases across 15 different LLM variations. They find\nthat simple details such as the order of the results presented to the model can\nhave material impact on the evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway here is that it's important to still experiment with performance on\nyour target use cases before trusting LLM evaluators - evaluate the evaluator!\nAll the usual prompt engineering techniques such as including few-shot examples\nare just as applicable here. In addition, fine-tuning specialist, more\neconomical evaluator models using human judgements can be a real unlock.\nI believe teams should consider shifting more of their human judgment efforts up\na level to focus on helping improve model evaluators. This will ultimately lead\nto a more scalable, repeatable and cost-effective evaluation process. As well as\none where the human expertise can be more targeted on the most important high\nvalue scenarios.",

Humanloop for example provides\ntemplates for popular use cases and best practises, with the ability to\nexperiment and customize. There are categories like general performance\n(latency, cost and error thresholds), behavioural (tone of voice, writing style,\ndiversity, factuality, relevance, etc.), ethical (bias, safety, privacy, etc.)\nand user experience (engagement, satisfaction, productivity, etc.).\nUnsurprisingly, starting with a small set of evaluators that cover the most\nimportant criteria is wise.

For example, a more diverse set of responses\nmight be more engaging, but also more likely to contain errors and higher\nquality can often come at a cost in terms of latency.\nThinking about these criteria upfront for your project can be a good hack to\nensure your team deeply understand the end goals of the application.",

    "content": "As discussed with the distinction between CI and observability; different stages\nof the app development lifecycle will have different evaluation needs. I've\nfound this lifecycle to naturally still consist of some sort of planning and\nscoping exercise, followed by cycles of development, deployment and monitoring.\nThese cycles are then repeated during the lifetime of the LLM app in order to\nintervene and improve performance. The stronger the teams, the more agile and\ncontinuous this process tends to be.\nDevelopment here will include both the typical app development; orchestrating\nyour LLM blocks in code, setting up your UIs, etc, as well more LLM specific\ninterventions and experimentation; including prompt engineering, context\ntweaking, tool integration updates and fine-tuning - to name a few. Both the\nchoices and quality of interventions to\noptimize your LLM performance are\nmuch improved if the right evaluation stages are in place. It facilitates a more\ndata-driven, systematic approach.\nFrom my experience there are 3 complementary stages of evaluation that are\nhighest ROI in supporting rapid iteration cycles of the LLM block related\ninterventions:\nInteractive - it's useful to have an interactive playground-like editor\nenvironment that allows rapid experimentation with components of the model\nand provides immediate evaluator feedback. This usually works best on a\nrelatively small number of scenarios. This allows teams (both technical and\nnon-technical) to quickly explore the design space of the LLM app and get an\ninformal sense of what works well.\n\nBatch offline - benchmarking or regression testing the most promising\nvariations over a larger curated set of scenarios to provide a more\nsystematic evaluation. Ideally a range of different evaluators for different\ncomponents of the app can contribute to this stage, some comparing against\ngold standard expected results for the task. This can fit naturally into\nexisting CI processes.\n\nMonitoring online - post deployment, real user interactions can be\nevaluated continuously to monitor the performance of the model. This process\ncan drive alerts, gather additional scenarios for offline evaluations and\ninform when to make further interventions. Staging deployments through\ninternal environments, or beta testing with selected cohorts of users first,\nare usually super valuable.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's usually necessary to co-evolve to some degree the evaluation framework\nalongside the app development as more data becomes available and requirements\nare clarified. The ability to easily version control and share across stages and\nteams both the evaluators and the configuration of your app can significantly\nimprove the efficiency of this process.",

By utilizing\nfew-shot prompting and including a representative subset of your existing data\nwithin the prompt, you can guide the synthesizer model to generate a wide range\nof supplementary examples.\nA quick pointer here is to prompt the model to generate a batch of examples at a\ntime, rather than one at a time, such that you can encourage characteristics\nlike diversity between examples. Or, similarly, feed previously generated\nexamples back into your prompt. For instance, for a customer service system,\nprompts could be designed to elicit responses across a variety of emotional\nstates, from satisfaction to frustration.\nA specific example of this is model red-teaming, or synthesizing adversarial\nexamples. This is where you use the synthesizer model to generate examples that\nare designed to break the system. For example, in\nRed Teaming Language Models with Language Models,\nthey uncover offensive replies, data leakage and other vulnerabilities in an LLM\nchat-bot using variations of few-shot prompts to generate adversarial questions.\nThey also leverage a pre-trained offensive classifier to help automate their\nevaluation process. However, it is worth noting they too point out the\nlimitations caused by LLM biases that limits diversity. They ultimately need to\ngenerate and filter hundreds of thousands of synthetic examples.\n\n\n\nAs with LLM evaluators, all the same rigour and tools should be applied to\nevaluating the quality of the synthetic data generator model before trusting it.",

Here's a few areas\nthat I'm particularly excited about working more on at Humanloop over the coming\nmonths that we'll touch on further in future posts:\nIncreasing adoption of AI based evaluators for all components of these\nsystems, with improved support for fine-tuning and specialisation happening at\nthis level. The existence of OpenAI's\nSuperalignment team\nshows there is focus here on the research front.\n\nSupporting more multi-modal applications deployed in production, with more\ntext, image, voice and even video based models coming online.\n\nMore complex agent-based workflows and experimenting with more multi-agent\nsetups and how evaluation needs to adapt to supervise these systems.\n\nMoving towards more end-to-end optimization for the components of these\ncomplex systems. A robust set of evaluators can provide an objective to\nmeasure performance, coupled with data synthesization to simulate the system.\n\n\nAt Humanloop, we've built an integrated solution for managing the development\nlifecycle of LLM apps from first principles, which includes some of the\nevaluation challenges discussed in this post.

    "content": "A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.\n\nYou already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our Prompt creation guide first.\n\n\n\n\nTo view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the Models page.\nTo create and use a tool follow the following steps:\n\n\nOpen the editor\nStart by opening the Humanloop Editor in your web browser. You can access this directly from your Humanloop account dashboard.\nSelect the model\nIn the editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose gpt-4 from the dropdown list.\nDefine the tool\nTo define a tool, you'll need to use the universal JSON Schema syntax syntax. For the purpose of this guide, let's select one of our preloaded example tools get_current_weather. In practice this would correspond to a function you have defined locally, in your own code, and you are defining the parameters and structure that you want OpenAI to respond with to integrate with that function.\n\n\nInput user text\nLet's input some user text relevant to our tool to trigger OpenAI to respond with the corresponding parameters. Since we're using a weather-related tool, type in: What's the weather in Boston?.\n\n\nIt should be noted that a user can ask a non-weather related question such as 'how are you today? ' and it likely wouldn't trigger the model to respond in a format relative to the tool.\nCheck assistant response\nIf correctly set up, the assistant should respond with a prompt to invoke the tool, including the name of the tool and the data it requires. For our get_current_weather tool, it might respond with the relevant tool name as well as the fields you requested, such as:\nInput tool parameters\nThe response can be used locally or for prototyping you can pass in any relevant values. In the case of our get_current_weather tool, we might respond with parameters such as temperature (e.g., 22) and weather condition (e.g., sunny). To do this, in the tool response add the parameters in the in the format { \"temperature\": 22, \"condition\": \"sunny\" }. To note, the response format is also flexible, inputting 22, sunny likely also works and might help you iterate more quickly in your experimentation.\nSubmit tool response\nAfter defining the parameters, click on the 'Run' button to send the Tool message to OpenAI.\nReview assistant response\nThe assistant should now respond using your parameters. For example, it might say: The current weather in Boston is sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees.\n\n\nSave the model config\nIf you are happy with your tool, you can save the model config. The tool will be saved on that model config and can be used again in the future by loading the model config again in the editor or by calling the model config via our SDK.",

Let's assume we've defined a get_current_weather tool, which returns the current weather for a specified location. We'll add it in via a \"tools\": tools, field. We've also defined a dummy get_current_weather method at the top. This can be replaced by your own function to fetch real values, for now we're hardcoding it to return a random temperature and cloudy for this example.\nCheck assistant response\nThe code above will make the call to OpenAI with the tool but it does nothing to handle the assistant response. When responding with a tool response the response should have a tool_calls field. Fetch that value and pass it to your own function. An example of this can be seen below. Replace the TODO - Add assistant handling logic in your code from above with the following. Multiple tool calls can be returned with the latest OpenAI models gpt-4-1106-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, so below we loop through the tool_calls and populate the response accordingly.\nReturn the tool response\nWe can then return the tool response to OpenAI. This can be done by formatting OpenAI tool message into the relative assistant message seen below along with a tool message with the function name and function response.\nReview assistant response\nThe assistant should respond with a message that incorporates the parameters you provided, for example: The current weather in Boston is 22 degrees and cloudy. The above can be run by adding the python handling logic at the both of your file:\nThe full code from this example can be seen below:",

Our guide for using Tool Calling in the Prompt Editor can be a useful reference in this case. We can use the get_current_weather schema in this case. Paste the following into the dialog:\nPress the Create button.\nNavigate to the Editor\nMake sure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as gpt-4o.\n\n\nSee the Models page for a list of models that support tool calling.\nAdd Tool to the Prompt definition.\nSelect 'Link existing Tool'\nIn the dropdown, go to the Link existing tool option. You should see your get_current_weather tool, click on it to link it to your editor.\n\n\nTest that the Prompt is working with the tool\nNow that your tool is linked you can start using it as you would normally use an inline tool. In the Chat section, in the User input, enter \"What is the weather in london?\"\nPress the Run button.\nYou should see the Assistant respond with the tool response and a new Tool field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in 22 into the tool response and press Run.\n\n\nThe model will respond with The current weather in London is 22 degrees.\nSave the Prompt\nYou've linked a tool to your model config, now let's save it. Press the Save button and name your model config weather-model-config.\n(Optional) Update the Tool\nNow that's we've linked your get_current_weather tool to your model config, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved weather-model-config config. Navigate back to the Tools in the sidebar and go to the Editor.\nChange the tool.\nLet's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to get_current_weather_updated and for the required fields, add unit as a required field. The should look like this now:\nSave the Tool\nPress the Save button, then the following Continue button to confirm.\nYour tool is now updated.\nTry the Prompt again\nNavigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the weather-model-config loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says get_current_weather_updated.\nIn the Chat section enter in again, What is the weather in london?, and press Run again.\nCheck the response\nYou should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the unit field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your model config.\n\n\n\n\nWhen updating your organization-level JSON Schema tools, remember that the\nchange will affect all the places you've previously linked the tool.

A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\nInstead of needing to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited, you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool."

You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy..\n\n\nPress Create Tool.\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.\nNavigate to the Editor\nGo to the Editor of your previously created project.\nAdd {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt\nDelete the existing prompt template and add {{ assistant-personalities(key) }} to your prompt.\n\n\nDouble curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor.  Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. {{ <tool-name>(key) }}.\nEnter the key as an input\nIn the input area set the value to helpful-assistant. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your key.\nPress the Run button\nStart the chat with the LLM and you can see the response of the LLM, as well as, see the key you previously defined add in the Chat on the right.\n\n\nChange the key to grumpy-assistant.\n\n\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to\nfirst run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\nPlay with the LLM\nAsk the LLM, I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'. You should see a grumpy response from \"Freddy\" now.\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant-personalities(\"grumpy-assistant\") }}. Delete the grumpy-assistant field and add it into your chat template.\nSave your Prompt.\nIf you're happy with you're grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.\n\n\nThe Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the model configs when you update them, as long as the key is the same.\n\n\nSince the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing\nthe values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools could affect the relative\npropmt's behaviour that won't be captured by the Prompt's version. This could\nbe exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the\nchanges are expected.",

The Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data are stored in Logs, which can then be re-used in Datasets.\n\n\nFYI: Prompts have recently been renamed from 'Projects'.

In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.\n\n\nTo set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file.

There are two ways to trigger Structured Outputs in the API:\nTool Calling: When defining a tool as part of your Prompt definition, you can now include a strict=true flag. The model will then output JSON data that adheres to the tool parameters schema definition.\n\n\nResponse Format: We have expanded the response_format with option json_schema and a request parameter to also include an optional json_schema field where you can pass in the schema you wish the model to adhere to.\n\n\nThis new response formant functionality is only supported by the latest OpenAPI model snapshots gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.\nWe will also be exposing this functionality in our Editor UI soon too!",

You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.\n\n\nFeature breakdown\nWe've introduced a new stats comparison view, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.\nThe performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.\nEvaluation reports also introduce an automatic deduplication feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a New Batch in the setup panel.\n\n\nHow to use Evaluation reports\nTo get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click Evaluate in the top right.\nThis will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.\n\nWhen you click Save, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.\nWhat's next\nWe're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations."

    "content": "New Tool creation flow\nYou can now create Tools in the same way as you create Prompts and Directories. This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.\n\nTo create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.\nTool editor and deployments\nYou can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.\n\nTool Editor\nThis replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit  any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.\n\nDeployment\nTools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.\nAnd example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature snippet(key) with a key/value pair of \"helpful\"/\"You are a helpful assistant\". You decide you would rather change the value to say \"You are a funny assistant\", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.\nPrompt labels and hover cards\nWe've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.\n\n\nThe labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.\nYou'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.\n\n\nAs a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.\n\n\nCommitting Prompt Versions\nBuilding on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.\nThis is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.\nIn addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use commits that can take commit messages, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.\nWe've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.\n\n\nWe'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.\nLet us know if you have any questions around these changes!"

    "content": "Add Evaluators to existing runs\nYou can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.\n\n\nImproved Evaluation Debug Console\nWe've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.\n\nOn any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.\nAfter clicking Run to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.\n\nLLM Evaluators\nWe expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.\nAfter clicking Run on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the LLM Evaluation Log column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.\n\nThis is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.\n\nTool projects\nWe have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config in the Editor as well as tools managed at organization level.\nIt is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.\n\nTool versioning\nIn the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.\nLogs\nAny logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our sessions guide and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session\nOffline Evaluations via SDK\nYou can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the Set up evaluations using API guide.\nSupport for new OpenAI Models\nFollowing OpenAI's latest model releases, you will find support for all the latest models in our Playground and Editor.\nGPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo\nIf your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release gpt-4-0125-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.\n\nWe also support the new gpt-4-turbo-preview model alias, which points to the latest gpt-4-turbo model without specifying a specific version.\nEmbedding Models\nFinally, the new embedding models - text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are also available for use via Humanloop. The small model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation ada-002 embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space."

Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.\n\n\nOur new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.\nOnce completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.\n\n\nSet up your first Human Evaluator run by following our guide.\nReturn inputs flag\nWe've introduced a return_inputs flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.\nAs context model windows get increasingly larger, for example Claude with 200k tokens, it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.\nWhen you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the inputs that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.\nAs always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.\nGemini\nYou can now use Google's latest LLMs, Gemini, in Humanloop.\nSetup\nTo use Gemini, first go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey and generate an API key. Then, save this under the \"Google\" provider on your API keys page.\nHead over to the playground, and you should see gemini-pro and gemini-pro-vision in your list of models.\n\n\nYou can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's /chatendpoints.\nFeatures\nGemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.\nHowever, note that while gemini-pro supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, gemini-pro-vision supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to Gemini's docs for more details.\nWhen providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL."

The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.\nThese .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.\nExporting via API\nTo fetch a .prompt file via the API, make POST request to https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export, where {id} is the ID of the model config (beginning with config_).\nExport from Humanloop\nYou can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click Export .prompt. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).\n\n\nEditor\nAdditionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press Cmd-Shift-E when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.\n\n\nMore details on our .prompt file format are available here. We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned."

    "content": "Improved RBACs\nWe've introduced more levels to our roles based access controls (RBACs).\nWe now distinguish between different roles to help you better manage your organization's access levels and permissions on Humanloop.\nThis is the first in a sequence of upgrades we are making around RBACs.\nOrganization roles\nEveryone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).\nA user can be one of the following rolws:\n**Admin:**The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.\nDeveloper:(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.\nMember:(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.\nRBACs summary\nHere is the full breakdown of roles and access:\nAction Member Developer Admin \nCreate and manage Prompts ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nInspect logs and feedback ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage evaluators ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nRun evaluations ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage datasets ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage API keys  ✔️ ✔️ \nManage prompt deployments  ✔️ ✔️ \nCreate and manage environments  ✔️ ✔️ \nSend invites   ✔️ \nSet user roles   ✔️ \nManage billing   ✔️ \nChange organization settings   ✔️ \n\nSelf hosted evaluations\nWe've added support for managing evaluations outside of Humanloop in your own code.\nThere are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.\nFor example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or LLM evaluator within your Humanloop project.\nWith this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.\nTo better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:\nRetrieve your curated datasets\n\nTrigger evaluation runs\n\nSend evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators\n\n\nBelow is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our guide on self-hosted evaluations.\nChat response\nWe've updated the response models of all of our /chat API endpoints to include an output message object.\nUp to this point, our chat and completion endpoints had a unified response model, where the content of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common output field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate tool_calls field.\nWhen making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an output_message field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nSnippet tool\nWe've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.\nThis functionality is provided by our new Snippet tool. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.\nFor example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.\nBefore now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.\nSet up the tool\nNavigate to the tools tab in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.\n\nWhen the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.\n\n\nYou can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.\nThe name field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as assistant below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax {{ assistant(key) }}.\nThe key is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.\nThe value is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.\n\nUse the tool\nNow your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.\n\nThe tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our editor environment the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.\nAbove we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the {{ <your-tool-name>(key) }} so in this case it would be {{ assistant(key) }}. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your key, in the screenshot above we used the helpful key to access the You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.\n\n\nIf you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.\nIf you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: {{ <your-tool-name>(\"key\") }}, so in this case it would be {{ assistant(\"helpful\") }}.\n\nThis is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.\nWhat's next\nExplore our other tools such as the Google or Pinecone Search.

The pre-existing tool_call parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.\nEach element in the tool_calls array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the tool_call_id must be provided, along with role=tool and the content containing the tool response.\nPython SDK improvements\nWe've improved the response models of our Python SDK and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.\nImproved response model types\nAs of versions >= 0.6.0, our Python SDK methods now return Pydantic models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.\nPreviously, you had to use the [...] syntax to access response values:\n\n\nWith Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from < 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the Raw HTTP Response section.\n\n\n🚧 Breaking change\nMoving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.\n\nSupport for timeout parameter\nThe default timeout used by aiohttp, which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.\nIn the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passingtimeout=1000 will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.\nMulti-modal models\nWe've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!\nWe've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V). You can now select gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.\nLet us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!\nEditor quick start\nTo get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.\nSelect gpt-4-vision-preview in the models dropdown.\n\nClick the Add images button within a user's chat message.\n\nTo add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select \"Upload image\" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.\n\nNote that you can add multiple images\n\n\n\n\nTo view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.\n\n\nAPI quick start\nAssuming you have deployed your gpt-4-vision-preview based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.\nAny generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.\nLimitations\nThere are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:\nImage messages are only supported by the gpt-4-vision-preview model in chat mode.\n\nGPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.\n\nYou cannot add images to the first system message.\n\n\nJSON mode and seed parameters\nWe've introduced new model config parameters for JSON mode and Seed in our Editor and API.\nWith the introduction of the new OpenAI turbo models you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; response_format and seed.\n\n\n\nSee further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format here and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter here.\nThese new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for response_format or seed will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.\n\n\n\n\nWhen using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.\nIn fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.",

Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.\n\n\nIn the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual {{ variable }} syntax, and include:\nlog_inputs - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated\n\nlog_prompt - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)\n\nlog_messages - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)\n\nlog_output - the output produced by the model\n\nlog_error - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced\n\ntestcase - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.\n\n\nTake a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.\nSince an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.\nImproved evaluator editor\nGiven our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.\n\nIn the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:\nSelect the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs\n\nSelect the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number\n\n\nUnderneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets."

With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.\nUnified errors\nOur users integrate the Humanloop /chat and /completion API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.\nErrors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of error response codes.\nWe've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for type, message, code and origin. The origin field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.\nFor example, for our /chat  endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for max_tokens, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.\nMonitor model reliability with evals\nWith this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within evaluation functions.\nYou can now turn on the Errors eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project.

    "content": "Evaluators\nWe've added Evaluators to Humanloop in beta!\nEvaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the Data tab.\nWe're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!\nCreate an Evaluator\nIf you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new Evaluations tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select + New Evaluator. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.\n\n\nWe'll pick Valid JSON for this guide.\n\n\nIn the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a datapoint argument and should return a value of the chosen type.\nCurrently, the available return types for an Evaluators are number and boolean. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.\nThe Datapoint argument\nThe datapoint passed into your function will be a Python dict with the following structure.\nTo inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click Random selection in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.\n\n\nFor this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple json.loads call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return False.\nDebugging\nOnce you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.\n\n\nIf your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.\nOnce you're happy with your Evaluator, click Create in the bottom left of the dialog.\nActivate / Deactivate an Evaluator\nYour Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the Evaluations tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.\nEach Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator on, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to that project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).\nYou can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.\nAggregations and Graphs\nAt the top of the Dashboard tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.\nAt the bottom of the Dashboard tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.\n\n\nAggregation\nFor the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:\nBoolean: percentage returning True of the total number of evaluated datapoints\n\nNumber: average value across all evaluated datapoints\n\n\nData logs\nIn the Data tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.\n\n\nFrom this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose Run evals from the Actions menu in the top right.\nAvailable Modules\nThe following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:\nmath\n\nrandom\n\ndatetime\n\njson (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)\n\njsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)\n\nsqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)\n\nrequests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).\n\n\nLet us know if you would like to see more modules available.",

    "content": "Introducing Tools\nToday we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.\nTools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.\nRead more on our blog and see an example of setting up a tool for semantic search.\nOpenAI functions API\nWe've updated our APIs to support OpenAI function calling.\nOpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our chat and log endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.\nThis unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.\nRecap on OpenAI functions\nAs described in the OpenAI documentation, the basic steps for using functions are:\nCall one of the models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal json-schema syntax.\n\nThe model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.\n\nYou can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (NB: the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).\n\nFinally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.\n\n\nOpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a get_current_weather function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:\nUsing with Humanloop tools\nOpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.\nWe've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.\nIn the cases of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.\nYou can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:\nChat endpoint\nWe show here how to update the run_conversation() method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:\nAfter running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:\n\nLog endpoint\nAlternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:\nComing soon\nSupport for defining tools in the playground!"

Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.\n\nThe environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.\n\nThe default environment\nBy default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the \"Active Deployment,\" such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed will use this environment.\n\n\nRenaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.\nUsing environments\nOnce created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.\nYou can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the Deployments section.\n\nAlternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.\nUsing environments via API\n\nFor v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as Get Active Config or Chat Deployed, you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional environment field.\nYou can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the \"Use API\" option.\nClicking on the \"Use API\" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the environment variable in practice."

    "content": "Improved Python SDK streaming response\nWe've improved our Python SDK's streaming response to contain the datapoint ID. Using the ID, you can now provide feedback to datapoints created through streaming.\nThe humanloop.chat_stream() and humanloop.complete_stream() methods now yield a dictionary with output and id.\nInstall the updated SDK with\nExample snippet\nOpenAI Azure support\nWe've just added support for Azure deployments of OpenAI models to Humanloop!\nThis update adds the ability to target Microsoft Azure deployments of OpenAI models to the playground and your projects. To set this up, visit your organization's settings.\nEnabling Azure OpenAI for your organization\nAs a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the Azure OpenAI docs for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.\n\nClick the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.\nYour endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.\nYour API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.\nWorking with Azure OpenAI models\nOnce you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the playground and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.\n\n\nREST API and Python / TypeScript support\nAs with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop REST API or our SDKs.\nIn the model_config.model field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).\nThe request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the provider_api_keys field, as shown in the example above.\nNote: Naming Model Deployments\nWhen you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of gpt-35-turbo in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like my-orgs-llm-model.\nIn order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like gpt-35-turbo, or the base model name with a custom prefix like my-org-gpt-35-turbo. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting max_tokens=-1 in your model configs fail to work as expected.",
