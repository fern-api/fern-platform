# Serverless - AWS Node.js Typescript

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/).

## Installation/deployment instructions

> **Requirements**: NodeJS `lts/fermium (v.14.15.0)`. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the same Node version in local and in your lambda's runtime.

- Run `pnpm install` to install the project dependencies
- Run `pnpm deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

## Deployment

You may notice there is no Github action explicitly configured to deploy this bot, that is because we're using Serverless' platform to monitor + deploy for us for now. This handles preview deploys as well as true production deploys.

More information on this can be found here: https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/dashboard/cicd

## Bots

We have two bots, one for staging/testing, and another that's the production app.

- **Test:** [[Development] Fern Bot](https://github.com/organizations/fern-api/settings/apps/development-fern-bot)
- **Production:** [Fern API](https://github.com/organizations/fern-api/settings/apps/fern-api)

<!-- ## Test your service

This template contains a single lambda function triggered by an HTTP request made on the provisioned API Gateway REST API `/hello` route with `POST` method. The request body must be provided as `application/json`. The body structure is tested by API Gateway against `src/functions/hello/schema.ts` JSON-Schema definition: it must contain the `name` property.

- requesting any other path than `/hello` with any other method than `POST` will result in API Gateway returning a `403` HTTP error code
- sending a `POST` request to `/hello` with a payload **not** containing a string property named `name` will result in API Gateway returning a `400` HTTP error code
- sending a `POST` request to `/hello` with a payload containing a string property named `name` will result in API Gateway returning a `200` HTTP status code with a message saluting the provided name and the detailed event processed by the lambda

> :warning: As is, this template, once deployed, opens a **public** endpoint within your AWS account resources. Anybody with the URL can actively execute the API Gateway endpoint and the corresponding lambda. You should protect this endpoint with the authentication method of your choice.

### Locally

In order to test the hello function locally, run the following command:

- `npx sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using NPM
- `yarn sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using Yarn

Check the [sls invoke local command documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/invoke-local/) for more information.

### Remotely

Copy and replace your `url` - found in Serverless `deploy` command output - and `name` parameter in the following `curl` command in your terminal or in Postman to test your newly deployed application.

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://myApiEndpoint/dev/hello' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Frederic"
}'
``` -->

## Project structure

> [!NOTE]
>
> This structure was the default structure that came with the template we used, but it is still representative of where files should go,
> what files are meant to do and how the project is generally structured.

The project code base is mainly located within the `src` folder. This folder is divided in:

- `functions` - containing code base and configuration for your lambda functions
- `libs` - containing shared code base between your lambdas

```
