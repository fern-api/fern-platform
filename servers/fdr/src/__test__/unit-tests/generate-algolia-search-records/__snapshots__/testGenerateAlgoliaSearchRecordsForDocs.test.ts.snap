 1. When a patient signs up or schedules an appointment, Eligibility [../api-reference/eligibility] is used to run a real-time
    eligibility check to confirm the patient's medical coverage.
 2. A day before the patient's appointment, Eligibility [../api-reference/eligibility] is used again to re-confirm the patient's
    coverage. It may have lapsed since they scheduled the appointment.
 3. After visit has been completed, an Encounter [../api-reference/encounters] is submitted to Candid. This either happens in
    real-time immediately when the visit is completed and/or signed, or in a batch job at the end of the day.
 4. Exports [../api-reference/exports] are downloaded and processed daily. Patient payments are sent to collect the balance owed

request to create an Encounter.


PREREQUISITES

 * Python 3.x or TypeScript 4.x installed on your system
 * Candid Client ID
 * Candid Client Secret


INSTALLATION

First, install the SDK using your package manager: bash pip install candidhealth # or poetry install, etc bash yarn add
candidhealth # or npm install, pnpm i, etc.


AUTHENTICATION

To make requests to our API, you'll need to use your API key for authentication. Initialize the SDK as follows:

\`\`\`python from candid.client import CandidApiClient from candid.environment import CandidApiEnvironment

client = CandidApiClient(
    environment=CandidApiEnvironment.STAGING,
    options=CandidApiClientOptions(
        client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    )
)
\`\`\`
</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
\`\`\`typescript
import { CandidApi, CandidApiClient, CandidApiEnvironment } from "candidhealth";

const client = new CandidApiClient({
    environment: CandidApiEnvironment.Staging,
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
});
\`\`\`
</CodeBlock>


Candid provides two environments, STAGING and PRODUCTION. Take care to pass the correct environment when creating your API client
so that requests are routed correctly.


MAKING AN EXAMPLE REQUEST

In this example, we'll create an Encounter using the V4 API.

\`\`\`python created_encounter = client.encounters.v_4.create( external_id=EncounterExternalId("emr-claim-id-abcd",
date_of_service=Date("2023-05-23", billable_status=BillableStatusType.BILLABLE, # or BillableStatusType.NOT_BILLABLE
responsible_party=ResponsiblePartyType.INSURANCE_PAY, # or ResponsiblePartyType.SELF_PAY patient=PatientCreate(

benefitsAssignedToProvider: true, }); \`\`\`


ERROR HANDLING

Each endpoint in our SDK documents which errors and exceptions can be raised if the request fails. These can be caught and handled
via native exception-handling:

\`\`\`python from candid.resources.encounters.resources.v_4.errors import EncounterExternalIdUniquenessError

try:
    created_encounter = client.encounters.v_4.create(...)
except EncounterExternalIdUniquenessError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
\`\`\`
</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
\`\`\`typescript
if (createEncounterResponse.ok) {
    const { body: newEncounter } = createEncounterResponse;
    console.log(newEncounter.encounterId);
} else {
    console.error(createEncounterResponse.error);
}
\`\`\`

WHAT IS A BREAKING CHANGE

We consider a break any change that meets one of the two following criteria:

 * A schema change to a request shape that leads to a previously valid client request shape becoming invalid.
 * A schema change to a response shape that leads to a previously valid client response parser becoming invalid.

Here are some examples of changes that we consider non-breaking:

 * Adding a new field to an existing response shape
 * Making a required field on a request shape optional
 * Removing an optional field on a response shape

Here are some examples of changes that we consider breaking:

 * Removing a required field on a response shape
 * Changing the data type of a field",

we brand decimal strings with the type \`Decimal\` to indicate that the server will parse them into Python
Decimal objects.

PAGINATION

We use pagination in our API to make sure that we don't return too much data at once. Many of our endpoints return an extension of
the ResourcePage type:

ResourcePage:
  items: T[]
  next_page_token: PageToken | None
  prev_page_token: PageToken | None



DECIMALS

We avoid using floating-point arithmetic that leads to imprecision. Instead, we use the Decimal type, which is a string alias type
that represents a decimal number as a string. These decimal strings are parsed into the Python Decimal class
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal-objects].


UNIONS

We use unions to represent a type that can be one of several different types. When a union shape is used, our union discriminant
will always be the type field unless otherwise specified.

We also expect that it is a non-breaking change to add a new union member to a union type. This means that if you handle a union

Developers find that Humanloop SDK/API slots well into existing code-based LLM orchestration without forcing upon them unhelpful
abstractions, while removing bottlenecks around updating prompts and running evaluations.

With Humanloop, companies are overcoming the challenges of building with AI and shipping groundbreaking applications with
confidence: By giving companies the right tools, Humanloop dramatically accelerates their AI adoption and makes it easy for best
practices to spread around an organization.

FIRST PROMPT IN A FEW MINUTES.


ACCOUNT SETUP


CREATE A HUMANLOOP ACCOUNT

If you haven’t already, create an account or log in to Humanloop


ADD AN OPENAI API KEY

If you’re the first person in your organization, you’ll need to add an API key to a model provider.

 1. Go to OpenAI and grab an API key [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys]
 2. In Humanloop Organization Settings [https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys] set up OpenAI as a model provider.

Using the Humanloop playground will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys
for Humanloop and the model providers private.


GET STARTED

### Create a Prompt File

When you first open Humanloop you’ll see your File navigation on the left. Click ‘+ New’ and create a Prompt.

[file:b5c48c6c-7a45-4a8a-b3d3-fc40a44fe208]

In the sidebar, rename this file to "Comedian Bot" now or later.


CREATE THE PROMPT TEMPLATE IN THE EDITOR

The left hand side of the screen defines your Prompt – the parameters such as model, temperature and template. The right hand side
is a single chat session with this Prompt.

[file:21fcfbca-9ae3-4d05-aa71-ec948f4ff97f]

Click the “+ Message” button within the chat template to add a system message to the chat template.

Add the following templated message to the chat template.

You are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.


This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called topic (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that
is provided each time you call this Prompt.

On the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the Inputs section for topic. Add

 1. Add a value fortopic e.g. music, jogging, whatever
 2. Click Run in the bottom right of the page

This will call OpenAI’s model return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is very funny.

You now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.


COMMIT YOUR FIRST VERSION OF THIS PROMPT

Next \`npm i humanloop\` to install the Humanloop SDK in your project.

Edit \`app/page.tsx\` to the following. This code stubs out the basic React components and state management we need for a chat interface.

"use client";

import { ChatMessageWithToolCall } from "humanloop";
import * as React from "react";

const { useState } = React;

export default function Home() {
const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

const onSend = async () => {
const userMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {
role: "user",
content: inputValue,
};

setInputValue("");

const newMessages = [...messages, userMessage];

setMessages(newMessages);

// REPLACE ME LATER
const res = "I'm not a language model. I'm just a string. 😞";
// END REPLACE ME

const assistantMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {
role: "assistant",
content: res,
};

setMessages([...newMessages, assistantMessage]);
};

const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
if (e.key === "Enter") {
onSend();
}
};

return (


Chess Tutor


{messages.map((msg, idx) => (

))}



User

 setInputValue(e.target.value)}
onKeyDown={(e) => handleKeyDown(e)}
>
 onSend()}
>

);
}

interface MessageRowProps {
msg: ChatMessageWithToolCall;
}

const MessageRow: React.FC = ({ msg }) => {
return (


{msg.role}

{msg.content as string}

);
};

\`\`\`


We shouldn't call the Humanloop SDK from the client's browser as this would require giving out the Humanloop API key, which _you should not do!_ Instead, we'll create a simple backend API route in Next.js which can perform the Humanloop requests on the Node server and proxy these back to the client.


Create a file containing the code below at \`app/api/chat/route.ts\`. This will automatically create an API route at \`/api/chat\`. In the call to the Humanloop SDK, you'll need to pass the project name you created in step 1.

\`\`\`typescript app/api/chat/route.ts
import { Humanloop, ChatMessageWithToolCall } from "humanloop";

if (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {
throw Error(
"no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: \`HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=..."
);
}

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
basePath: "https://api.humanloop.com/v4",
apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(req: Request): Promise {
const messages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] = (await req.json()) as ChatMessageWithToolCall[];
console.log(messages);

const response = await humanloop.chatDeployed({
project: "chat-tutorial-ts",
messages,
});

return new Response(JSON.stringify(response.data.data[0].output));
}
\`\`\`

In this code, we're calling \`humanloop.chatDeployed\`. This function is used to target the model which is actively deployed on your project - in this case it should be the model we set up in step 1. Other related functions in the [SDK reference](/reference/sdks) (such as \`humanloop.chat\`) allow you to target a specific model config (rather than the actively deployed one) or even specify model config directly in the function call.

When we receive a response from Humanloop, we strip out just the text of the chat response and send this back to the client via a \`Response\` object (see [Next.js - Route Handler docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers)). The Humanloop SDK response contains much more data besides the raw text, which you can inspect by logging to the console.

For the above to work, you'll need to ensure that you have a \`.env.local\` file at the root of your project directory with your Humanloop API key. You can generate a Humanloop API key by clicking your name in the top right of the Playground and selecting [API keys.](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) This environment variable will only be available on the Next.js server, not on the client (see [Next.js - Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)).

\`\`\`text .env.local
HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=...
\`\`\`

Now, modify \`page.tsx\` to use a \`fetch\` request against the new API route.

\`\`\`typescript page.tsx
const onSend = async () => {

// REPLACE ME NOW

setMessages(newMessages);

const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
body: JSON.stringify(newMessages),
});

const res = await response.json();

// END REPLACE ME
}
\`\`\`

You should now find that your application works as expected. When we send messages from the client, a GPT response appears beneath (after a delay).



Back in your Humanloop Prompt dashboard you should see Logs being recorded as clients interact with your model.

    ],
    "content": "(Note: requires Node version 18+).

You may notice that model responses can take a while to appear on screen. Currently, our Next.js API route blocks while the entire response is generated, before finally sending the whole thing back to the client browser in one go. For longer generations, this can take some time, particularly with larger models like GPT-4. Other model config settings can impact this too.

To provide a better user experience, we can deal with this latency by streaming tokens back to the client as they are generated and have them display eagerly on the page. The Humanloop SDK wraps the model providers' streaming functionality so that we can achieve this. Let's incorporate streaming tokens into our app next.

Edit the API route at to look like the following. Notice that we have switched to using the \`humanloop.chatDeployedStream\` function, which offers [Server Sent Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) streaming as new tokens arrive from the model provider.

\`\`\`typescript app/api/chat/route.ts
import { Humanloop, ChatMessageWithToolCall } from "humanloop";

if (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {
throw Error(
"no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: \`HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=..."
);
}

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
basePath: "https://api.humanloop.com/v4",
apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(req: Request): Promise {
const messages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] = (await req.json()) as ChatMessageWithToolCall[];

const response = await humanloop.chatDeployedStream({
project: "chat-tutorial-ts",
messages,
});

return new Response(response.data);
}
\`\`\`

Now, modify the \`onSend\` function in \`page.tsx\` to the following. This streams the response body in chunks, updating the UI each time a new chunk arrives.

\`\`\`typescript app/page.tsx
const onSend = async () => {
const userMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {
role: "user",
content: inputValue,
};

setInputValue("");

const newMessages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] = [
...messages,
userMessage,
{ role: "assistant", content: "" },
];

setMessages(newMessages);

const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
body: JSON.stringify(newMessages),
});

if (!response.body) throw Error();

const decoder = new TextDecoder();
const reader = response.body.getReader();
let done = false;
while (!done) {
const chunk = await reader.read();
const value = chunk.value;
done = chunk.done;
const val = decoder.decode(value);
const jsonChunks = val
.split("}{")

const updatedLastMessage = messages.slice(-1)[0];

return [
...messages.slice(0, -1),
{
...updatedLastMessage,
content: (updatedLastMessage.content as string) + tokens,
},
];
});
}
};
\`\`\`

You should now find that tokens stream onto the screen as soon as they are available.

// OLD
// {messages.map((msg, idx) => (
//   
// ))}

// NEW
{chatListItems.map((item, idx) => (

))}
\`\`\`

Next, we need to create a Next.js API route for submitting feedback, similar to the one we had for making a \`/chat\` request. Create a new file at the path \`app/api/feedback/route.ts\` with the following code:

\`\`\`typescript api/feedback/route.ts
import { Humanloop } from "humanloop";

if (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {
throw Error(
"no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: \`HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=..."
);
}

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,
});

interface FeedbackRequest {
id: string;
value: string;
}

export async function POST(req: Request): Promise {
const feedbackRequest: FeedbackRequest = await req.json();

await humanloop.feedback({
type: "rating",
data_id: feedbackRequest.id,
value: feedbackRequest.value,
});

return new Response();
}
\`\`\`

This code simply proxies the feedback request through the Next.js server. You should now see feedback buttons on the relevant rows in chat.



When you click one of these feedback buttons and visit the Prompt in Humanloop, you should see the feedback logged against the log.

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS TUTORIAL, YOU'LL BUILD A SIMPLE CLONE OF CHATGPT WITH NEXT.JS AND THE HUMANLOOP TYPESCRIPT SDK.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have built a simple ChatGPT-style interface using Humanloop as the backend to manage
interactions with your model provider, track user engagement and experiment with model configuration.

If you just want to leap in, the complete repo for this project is available on GitHub here.

A simple ChatGPT-style interface using the Humanloop SDK to manage interaction with your model provider, track user engagement,
log results and help you evaluate and improve your model. [file:9eaa337b-5b8b-4465-96f4-3a6b20faedb9]


STEP 1: CREATE A NEW PROMPT IN HUMANLOOP

First, create a Prompt with the name chat-tutorial-ts. Go to the Editor tab on the left. Here, we can play with parameters and
prompt templates to create a model which will be accessible via the Humanloop SDK.

If this is your first time using the Playground, you'll be prompted to enter an OpenAI API key. You can create one by going
[here.](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

The playground is an interactive environment where you can experiment with prompt templates to create a model which will be
accessible via the Humanloop SDK.

[file:31005798-cda7-47a9-aafd-3fb051422797]

Let's try to create a chess tutor. Paste the following system message into the Chat template box on the left-hand side.

You are a chess grandmaster, who is also a friendly and helpful chess instructor.

Play a game of chess with the user. Make your own moves in reply to the student. 

Explain succintly why you made that move. Make your moves in algebraic notation.


In the Parameters section above, select gpt-4 as the model. Click Commit and enter a commit message such as "GPT-4 Grandmaster".

Navigate back to the Dashboard tab in the sidebar. Your new Prompt Version is visible in the table at the bottom of the Prompt
dashboard.


STEP 2: SET UP A NEXT.JS APPLICATION

Now, let's turn to building out a simple Next.js application. We'll use the Humanloop Typescript SDK to provide programmatic
access to the model we just created.

Run npx create-next-app@latest to create a fresh Next.js project. Accept all the default config options in the setup wizard (which
includes using Typescript, Tailwind, and the Next.js app router). Now npm run dev to fire up the development server.

Next npm i humanloop to install the Humanloop SDK in your project.

Edit app/page.tsx to the following. This code stubs out the basic React components and state management we need for a chat
interface.

"use client";

import { ChatMessageWithToolCall } from "humanloop";
import * as React from "react";

const { useState } = React;

export default function Home() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<ChatMessage[]>([]);
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const onSend = async () => {
    const userMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {
      role: "user",
      content: inputValue,
    };

    setInputValue("");

    const newMessages = [...messages, userMessage];

    setMessages(newMessages);

    // REPLACE ME LATER
    const res = "I'm not a language model. I'm just a string. 😞";
    // END REPLACE ME

    const assistantMessage: ChatMessageWithToolCall = {
      role: "assistant",
      content: res,
    };

    setMessages([...newMessages, assistantMessage]);
  };

  const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.key === "Enter") {
      onSend();
    }
  };

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center min-h-screen p-8 md:p-24">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 sm:truncate sm:text-3xl sm:tracking-tight">
        Chess Tutor
      </h1>
      <div className="flex-col w-full mt-8">
        {messages.map((msg, idx) => (
          <MessageRow key={idx} msg={msg}></MessageRow>
        ))}

        <div className="flex w-full">
          <div className="min-w-[70px] uppercase text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300 pt-2">
            User
          </div>
          <input
            className="w-full px-4 py-1 mr-3 leading-tight text-gray-700 break-words bg-transparent border-none appearance-none dark:text-gray-200 flex-grow-1 focus:outline-none"
            type="text"
            placeholder="Type your message here..."
            aria-label="Prompt"
            value={inputValue}
            onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
            onKeyDown={(e) => handleKeyDown(e)}
          ></input>
          <button
            className="px-3 font-medium text-gray-500 uppercase border border-gray-300 rounded dark:border-gray-100 dark:text-gray-200 hover:border-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500"
            onClick={() => onSend()}
          >
            Send
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}

interface MessageRowProps {
  msg: ChatMessageWithToolCall;
}

const MessageRow: React.FC<MessageRowProps> = ({ msg }) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex pb-4 mb-4 border-b border-gray-300">
      <div className="min-w-[80px] uppercase text-xs text-gray-500 leading-tight pt-1">
        {msg.role}
      </div>
      <div className="pl-4 whitespace-pre-line">{msg.content as string}</div>
    </div>
  );
};


We shouldn't call the Humanloop SDK from the client's browser as this would require giving out the Humanloop API key, which _you
should not do!_ Instead, we'll create a simple backend API route in Next.js which can perform the Humanloop requests on the Node
server and proxy these back to the client.

Create a file containing the code below at app/api/chat/route.ts. This will automatically create an API route at /api/chat. In the
call to the Humanloop SDK, you'll need to pass the project name you created in step 1.

import { Humanloop, ChatMessageWithToolCall } from "humanloop";

if (!process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY) {
  throw Error(
    "no Humanloop API key provided; add one to your .env.local file with: \`HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=..."
  );
}

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
  basePath: "https://api.humanloop.com/v4",
  apiKey: process.env.HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const messages: ChatMessageWithToolCall[] = (await req.json()) as ChatMessageWithToolCall[];
  console.log(messages);

  const response = await humanloop.chatDeployed({
    project: "chat-tutorial-ts",
    messages,
  });

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(response.data.data[0].output));
}


In this code, we're calling humanloop.chatDeployed. This function is used to target the model which is actively deployed on your
project - in this case it should be the model we set up in step 1. Other related functions in the SDK reference [/reference/sdks]
(such as humanloop.chat) allow you to target a specific model config (rather than the actively deployed one) or even specify model
config directly in the function call.

When we receive a response from Humanloop, we strip out just the text of the chat response and send this back to the client via a
Response object (see Next.js - Route Handler docs
[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers]). The Humanloop SDK response contains much more
data besides the raw text, which you can inspect by logging to the console.

For the above to work, you'll need to ensure that you have a .env.local file at the root of your project directory with your
Humanloop API key. You can generate a Humanloop API key by clicking your name in the top right of the Playground and selecting API
keys. [https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys] This environment variable will only be available on the Next.js server, not on
the client (see Next.js - Environment Variables
[https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables]).

HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=...


Now, modify page.tsx to use a fetch request against the new API route.

  const onSend = async () => {
    
        // REPLACE ME NOW
        
    setMessages(newMessages);

    const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(newMessages),
    });

    const res = await response.json();
    
    // END REPLACE ME
  }


You should now find that your application works as expected. When we send messages from the client, a GPT response appears beneath
(after a delay).

[file:500f4135-ec50-46e8-be1a-e5883afd352f]

Back in your Humanloop Prompt dashboard you should see Logs being recorded as clients interact with your model.

[file:5e3a5530-bf8b-482d-8f1a-bca6e6f11323]


STEP 3: STREAMING TOKENS

(Note: requires Node version 18+).

You may notice that model responses can take a while to appear on screen. Currently, our Next.js API route blocks while the entire
response is generated, before finally sending the whole thing back to the client browser in one go. For longer generations, this
can take some time, particularly with larger models like GPT-4. Other model config settings can impact this too.

To provide a better user experience, we can deal with this latency by streaming tokens back to the client as they are generated
and have them display eagerly on the page. The Humanloop SDK wraps the model providers' streaming functionality so that we can
achieve this. Let's incorporate streaming tokens into our app next.

Edit the API route at to look like the following. Notice that we have switched to using the humanloop.chatDeployedStream function,
which offers Server Sent Event [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events] streaming as new tokens
arrive from the model provider.

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS TUTORIAL, YOU’LL USE GPT-4 AND HUMANLOOP TO QUICKLY CREATE A GPT-4 CHAT APP THAT EXPLAINS TOPICS IN THE STYLE
OF DIFFERENT EXPERTS.

At the end of this tutorial, you’ll have created your first GPT-4 app. You’ll also have learned how to:

 1. Create a project using the Humanloop Playground
 2. Use the Humanloop SDK to call Open AI GPT-4 and log your results
 3. Capture feedback from your end users to evaluate and improve your model.

This tutorial picks up where the Quick Start [/docs/quickstart] left off. If you’ve already followed the quick start you can skip
to step 4.

In this tutorial, you'll build a simple GPT-4 app that can explain a topic in the style of different experts.
[file:b6c89f09-58b7-4884-8e2e-e26e5fcffd41]


STEP 1: OPEN THE HUMANLOOP PLAYGROUND

When you first open the playground [https://app.humanloop.com/playground] you’ll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key. You can
do that by going here [https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys] and copying the API key.

If you don’t already have an OpenAI account, you’ll need to create one. Paste your key into the box in the Humanloop app.

Using the Humanloop playground will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the OpenAI playground does.


STEP 2: CREATE A PROMPT TEMPLATE

First switch to completion mode in the playground by opening the dropdown menu in the config pane. Select Switch to completion
mode.

[file:69a8a50d-44e1-4e1d-afc6-ea72829190bb]

Copy the following text into the prompt box on the left-hand-side of the playground, and overwrite any text that is already there.

Write a short article about {{topic}} as written by {{expert}}:


This sentence is an example of a prompt template [/docs/key-concepts#prompt-templates]. It’s an instruction to GPT-4 but with
slots for user input.
The slots are surrounded by two curly braces. On the right side of the page, you’ll now see three boxes with inputs for “expert”
and “topic”.

[file:b3215ae0-fb3a-45b8-a46d-e4c30dbfda88]
 1. For the top set of the input boxes enter a famous person. Suggestions: Einstein, David Beckham, Elon Musk
 2. Put in a different topic in the "topic" box. Suggestions: relativity, football, spaceships
 3. Click Run in the same section of the inputted topic and expert on right side of the page.

This will call GPT-4 and return answers for each of the input groups you have.

Click Run a few times to get a sense of the different possible outputs. Try changing the temperature on the left panel and see
what impact it has.

[file:e8913af6-615c-46de-ab38-f62c33fd8718]


STEP 3: CREATE YOUR FIRST PROJECT

You now have a first prompt-template that you might want to use in an app. To create a project:

 1. Click Save
 2. Click or create new project
 3. Enter a Project name of "learn anything" and set the Model config name as "expert-topics"
 4. Click Create project
 5. Now go to your project by clicking the Open in project editor button. Thats it!


STEP 4: ADD THE MODEL TO AN APP

Now that you’ve found a good prompt and settings, you’re ready to build the "Learn anything from anyone" app! We’ve written some
code to get you started — follow the instructions below to download the code and run the app.

When you run the app, this is what you should see. [file:b6c89f09-58b7-4884-8e2e-e26e5fcffd41]


SETUP

If you don’t have Python 3 installed, install it from here [https://www.python.org/downloads/]. Then download the code by cloning
this repository [https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-tutorial-python] in your terminal:

git clone git@github.com:humanloop/humanloop-tutorial-python.git


If you prefer not to use git, you can alternatively download the code using this zip file
[https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-tutorial-python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip].

In your terminal, navigate into the project directory and make a copy of the example environment variables file.

cd humanloop-tutorial-python  
cp .example.env .env


Copy your Humanloop API key [https://app.humanloop.com/account/settings] and set it as HUMANLOOP_API_KEY in your newly created
.env file. Copy your OpenAI API key [https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys] and set it as the OPENAI_API_KEY.


RUN THE APP

Run the following commands in your terminal in the project directory to install the dependencies and run the app.

python -m venv venv  
. venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
flask run


Open http://localhost:5000 [http://localhost:5000] in your browser and you should see the app. If you type in the name of an
expert, e.g "Aristotle", and a topic that they're famous for, e.g "ethics", the app will try to generate an explanation in their
style.

Press the thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons to register your feedback on whether the generation is any good.

Try a few more questions. Perhaps change the name of the expert and keep the topic fixed.


STEP 5: VIEW THE DATA ON HUMANLOOP

Now that you have a working app you can use Humanloop to measure and improve performance. Go back to the Humanloop app and go to
your project named "learn-anything".

On the Models dashboard you'll be able to see how many data points have flowed through the app as well as how much feedback you've
received. Click on your model in the table at the bottom of the page.

[file:655080ea-4eb9-4b6d-a7f5-dda9d120a15b]

Click View data in the top right. Here you should be able to see each of your generations as well as the feedback that's been
logged against them. You can also add your own internal feedback by clicking on a datapoint in the table and using the feedback
buttons.


STEP 6: UNDERSTAND THE CODE

Open up the file app.py in the "openai-quickstart-python" folder. There are a few key code snippets that will let you understand
how the app works.

Between lines 30 and 41 you'll see the following code.

expert = request.form["Expert"]
topic = request.form["Topic"]

# hl.complete automatically logs the data to your project.
complete_response = humanloop.complete_deployed(
  project="learn-anything", 
  inputs={"expert": expert, "topic": topic},
  provider_api_keys={"openai": OPENAI_API_KEY}
)

data_id = complete_response.body["data"][0]["id"]
result = complete_response.body["data"][0]["output"]


On line 34 you can see the call to humanloop.complete_deployed which takes the project name and project inputs as variables.
humanloop.complete_deployed calls GPT-4 and also automatically logs your data to the Humanloop app.

In addition to returning the result of your model on line 39, you also get back a data_id which can be used for recording feedback
about your generations.

On line 51 of app.py, you can see an example of logging feedback to Humanloop.

# Send feedback to Humanloop  
humanloop.feedback(type="rating", value="good", data_id=data_id)


The call to humanloop.feedback uses the data_id returned above to associate a piece of positive feedback with that generation.

In this app there are two feedback groups rating (which can be good or bad) and actions, which here is the copy button and also
indicates positive feedback from the user.


STEP 7: ADD A NEW MODEL CONFIG

If you experiment a bit, you might find that the model isn't initially that good. The answers are often too short or not in the
style of the expert being asked. We can try to improve this by experimenting with other prompts.

 1. Click on your model on the model dashboard and then in the top right, click Editor
    
    [file:58e889f9-8cf9-4c15-9101-c68615089c57]

 2. Edit the prompt template to try and improve the prompt. Try changing the maximum number of tokens using the Max tokens slider,
    or the wording of the prompt.
    
    [file:d74e0384-5fff-435c-ba36-5e470222b891]

Here are some prompt ideas to try out. Which ones work better?

the style of {{expert}} on {{topic}} \`\`\`

 3. Click Save to add the new model to your project. Add it to the "learn-anything" project.
    
    [file:26b86fcc-1d67-409b-930c-d915000d8a9a]

 4. Go to your project dashboard. At the top left of the page, click menu of "production" environment card. Within that click the
    button Change deployment and set a new model config as active; calls to humanloop.complete_deployed will now use this new
    model. Now go back to the app and see the effect!

STEP 8: GO HOME HAPPY!

And that’s it! You should now have a full understanding of how to go from the Humanloop playground to a deployed and functioning
app. You've learned how to create prompt templates, capture user feedback and deploy a new model from the playground.

SUBTITLE: HOW TO SET UP A PROJECT IN HUMANLOOP USING THE PYTHON SDK.

The Humanloop Python SDK allows you to programmatically set up Humanloop projects with model configs
[/docs/key-concepts#model-config] and a feedback schema [/docs/key-concepts#feedback].


PREREQUISITES

 1. A Humanloop account. If you don't have one, you can create an account now by going to the Sign up page
    [https://app.humanloop.com/signup].


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section. Otherwise, open up your
terminal and follow these steps:

 1. Install the Humanloop Python SDK:
    
    pip install humanloop
    

 2. Start a Python interpreter:
    
    python
    

 3. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (get your API key from your Organisation Settings page
    [https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys])
    
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")
    


CREATE A PROJECT

Continue in the same Python interpreter (where you have run humanloop = Humanloop(...)).

 1. Create the project
    
    project_response = humanloop.projects.create(name="{{your-organization}}-sdk-tutorial")
    project_id = project_response.body["id"]
    

 2. Add your own feedback types and values
    By default your project has a feedback type rating with labels good and bad.
    
    humanloop.projects.update_feedback_types(
        id=project_id,
        body=[{
            "type": "action",

SUBTITLE: A WALKTHROUGH OF HOW TO SET UP THE SDK TO USE HUMANLOOP.COMPLETE()

The Humanloop Python SDK allows you to easily replace your openai.Completions.create() calls with a humanloop.complete() call
that, in addition to calling OpenAI to get a generation, automatically logs the data to your Humanloop project.


PREREQUISITES

 1. You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
    [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.

This guide assumes you're using an OpenAI model. If you want to use other providers or your own model please also look at our
[guide to using your own model](/docs/use-your-own-model-provider).


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

The SDK requires Python 3.8 or greater.

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section. Otherwise, open up your
terminal and follow these steps:

 1. Install the Humanloop Python SDK:
    
    pip install humanloop
    

We recommend pinning your installed Humanloop SDK to a specific version as our API is still currently evolving.

You will be kept informed of the changes as we make them, and we do support older versions to accommodate a transition period.


 2. Start a Python interpreter:
    
    python
    

 3. Test your installation by running:
    
    >>> from humanloop import Humanloop
    


ACTIVATE A MODEL

 1. Log in to Humanloop and navigate to the Dashboard tab of your project.
 2. Ensure that the default environment is in green at the top of the dashboard, the default environment is mapped to your active
    deployment. If there is no active deployment set, then use the dropdown button for the default environment and select the
    Change deployment option to select one of your existing model configs to use to generate. You also need to confirm the model
    you config you have deployed is a Completion model. This can be confirmed by clicking on the config in the table and viewing
    the Endpoint, making sure it says Complete.[file:e67ea8ae-21f7-426e-ae2c-8f1e47c87dd6]


USE THE SDK TO CALL YOUR MODEL

Now you can use the SDK to generate completions and log the results to your project. The following code demonstrates how:

SUBTITLE: A WALKTHROUGH OF HOW TO SET UP THE SDK TO USE HUMANLOOP.CHAT()

The Humanloop Python SDK allows you to easily replace your openai.ChatCompletions.create() calls with a humanloop.chat() call
that, in addition to calling OpenAI to get a response, automatically logs the data to your Humanloop project.


PREREQUISITES

 1. You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
    [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.

This guide assumes you're using an OpenAI model. If you want to use other providers or your own model please also look at our
[guide to using your own model](/docs/use-your-own-model-provider).


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

The SDK requires Python 3.8 or greater.

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section. Otherwise, open up your
terminal and follow these steps:

 1. Install the Humanloop Python SDK:
    
      <Tip>
    
    
    We recommend pinning your installed Humanloop SDK to a specific version as our API is still currently evolving.
    
    You will be kept informed of the changes as we make them, and we do support older versions to accommodate a transition period.
    
      </Tip>
    
    
    pip install humanloop
    

 2. Start a Python interpreter:
    
    python
    

 3. Test your installation by running:
    
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    


ACTIVATE A MODEL

 1. Log in to Humanloop and navigate to the Models tab of your project.
 2. Ensure that the default environment is in green at the top of the dashboard. The default environment is mapped to your active
    deployment. If there is no active deployment set, then use the dropdown button for the default environment and select the
    Change deployment option to select one of your existing model configs to use to generate. You also need to confirm the model
    you config you have deployed is a Chat model. This can be confirmed by clicking on the config in the table and viewing the
    Endpoint, making sure it says Chat.

[file:2eb8fe9c-e955-4943-aba9-761226d52caf]


USE THE SDK TO CALL YOUR MODEL

Now you can use the SDK to generate completions and log the results to your project. The following code demonstrates how:

from humanloop import Humanloop

# You need to initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")

# humanloop.chat_deployed(...) will call the active model config on your project.
# The inputs must match the input of the chat template in your project.
chat_response = humanloop.chat_deployed(
    project="<YOUR UNIQUE PROJECT NAME>",
       # inputs required by your chat_template - for example your templated system message.
    inputs={"persona": "paul graham from YC"},
      messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"}
    ]
)

# A single call to chat may return multiple outputs.
data_id = chat_response.body["data"][0]["id"]
output = chat_response.body["data"][0]["output"]

# You can also access the raw response from OpenAI.
print(chat_response.body["provider_responses"])


Navigate to your project's Logs tab in the browser to see the recorded inputs, messages and responses of your chat.

SUBTITLE: >- YOU CAN RECORD FEEDBACK ON GENERATIONS FROM YOUR USERS USING THE HUMANLOOP PYTHON SDK. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO MONITOR HOW
YOUR GENERATIONS PERFORM WITH YOUR USERS.

This guide shows how to use the Humanloop SDK to record user feedback on datapoints. This works equivalently for both the
completion and chat APIs.


PREREQUISITES

 1. Already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
    [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 2. Already have integrated humanloop.chat() or humanloop.complete() to log generations with the Python or TypeScript SDKs. If
    not, follow our guide to integrating the SDK [/docs/generate-and-log-with-the-sdk].


RECORD FEEDBACK WITH THE DATAPOINT ID

 1. Extract the data ID from the humanloop.complete_deployed() response.
    
    complete_response = humanloop.complete_deployed(  
        project="<YOUR UNIQUE PROJECT NAME>",  
        inputs={"question": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"},
    )
    
    data_id = completion.body["data"][0]["id"]
    

 2. Call humanloop.feedback() referencing the saved datapoint ID to record user feedback.
    You can also include the source of the feedback when recording it.
    
    # You can capture a single piece feedback
    humanloop.feedback(data_id=data_id, type="rating", value="good")
    
    # And you can associate the feedback to a specific user.
    humanloop.feedback(data_id=data_id, type="rating", value="good", user="user_123456")
    

The feedback recorded for each datapoint can be viewed in the Logs tab of your project.

[file:9b2b6885-f733-4508-8ecc-b915821f959a]

Different use cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user
interaction. There are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:

 1. Explicit feedback: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.
 2. Implicit feedback: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example,
    whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).
 3. Free-form feedback: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.


RECORDING CORRECTIONS AS FEEDBACK

It can also be useful to allow your users to correct the outputs of your model. This is strong feedback signal and can also be
considered as ground truth data for finetuning later.

# You can capture text based feedback to record corrections
humanloop.feedback(data_id=data_id, type="correction", value="A user provided completion...")

SUBTITLE: >- UPLOADING HISTORIC MODEL INPUTS AND GENERATIONS TO AN EXISTING HUMANLOOP PROJECT.

The Humanloop Python SDK allows you to upload your historic model data to an existing Humanloop project. This can be used to
warm-start your project. The data can be considered for feedback and review alongside your new user generated data.


PREREQUISITES

 1. You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
    [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

The SDK requires Python 3.8 or greater.

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section. Otherwise, open up your
terminal and follow these steps:

 1. Install the Humanloop Python SDK:
    
    pip install humanloop
    

 2. Start a Python interpreter:
    
    python
    

 3. Test your installation by running:
    
    >>> from humanloop import Humanloop
    


LOG HISTORIC DATA

Grab your API key from your Settings page [https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys].

 1. Set up your code to first load up your historic data and then log this to Humanloop, explicitly passing details of the model
    config (if available) alongside the inputs and output:
    
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    import openai
    
    # Initialize Humanloop with your API key
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")
    
    # NB: Add code here to load your existing model data before logging it to Humanloop
    
    # Log the inputs, outputs and model config to your project - this log call can take batches of data.
    log_response = humanloop.log(
        project="<YOUR UNIQUE PROJECT NAME>",
        inputs={"question": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"},
        output=output,
        config={
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "prompt_template": "Answer the following question like Paul Graham from YCombinator: {{question}}",
            "temperature": 0.2,
        },
          source="sdk",
    )
    
    # Use the datapoint IDs to associate feedback received later to this datapoint.
    data_id = log_response.body["id"]
    

 2. The process of capturing feedback then uses the returned log_id as before.
    See our guide to recording feedback with the SDK [./overview].

SUBTITLE: INTEGRATING HUMANLOOP AND RUNNING AN EXPERIMENT WHEN USING YOUR OWN MODELS.

The humanloop.complete()and humanloop.chat() call encapsulates the LLM provider calls (for example openai.Completions.create()),
the model-config selection and logging steps in a single unified interface. There may be scenarios that you wish to manage the LLM
provider calls directly in your own code instead of relying on Humanloop.

For example, you may be using an LLM provider that currently is not directly supported by Humanloop such as Hugging Face.

To support using your own model provider, we provide additional humanloop.log() and humanloop.projects.get_config() methods in the
SDK.

In this guide, we walk through how to use these SDK methods to log data to Humanloop and run experiments.


PREREQUISITES

You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
[/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section. Otherwise, open up your
terminal and follow these steps:

### Install the Humanloop Python SDK: \`\`\`shell pip install humanloop \`\`\` ### Start a Python interpreter: \`\`\`shell python \`\`\` ###
Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (get your API key from your API Keys page) \`\`\`python >>> from humanloop import
Humanloop >>> humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="") \`\`\`


LOG DATA TO YOUR PROJECT

### Set up your code to first get your model config from Humanloop, then call your LLM provider to get a completion (or chat
response) and then log this, alongside the inputs, config and output:

from humanloop import Humanloop
import openai

# Initialize Humanloop with your API key
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")

project_id = "<YOUR PROJECT ID>"

config_response = humanloop.projects.get_config(id=project_id)
config = config_response.body["config"]

client = openai.OpenAI(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    api_key="<YOUR OPENAI API KEY>",
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }
    ],
    model=config["model"],
      temperature=config["temperature"]
)

# Parse the output from the OpenAI response.
output = chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

# Log the inputs, outputs and model config to your project.
log_response = humanloop.log(
    project_id=project_id,
    inputs={"question": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"},
    output=output,
    config=config
)

# Use this ID to associate feedback received later to this datapoint.
data_id = log_response.body["id"]



THE PROCESS OF CAPTURING FEEDBACK THEN USES THE RETURNED DATA_ID AS BEFORE.

See our guide to recording feedback with the SDK [/docs/guides/generate-and-log-with-the-sdk].


YOU CAN ALSO LOG IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ALONGSIDE THE INPUT AND OUTPUTS:

# Log the inputs, outputs and model config to your project.
log_response = humanloop.log(
    project_id=project_id,
    inputs={"question": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"},
    output=output,
    config=config,
    feedback={"type": "rating", "value": "good"}
)


Note that you can also use a similar pattern for non-OpenAI LLM providers. For example, logging results from Hugging Face’s
Inference API:

import requests
from humanloop import Humanloop
 
# Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")
 
# Make a generation using the Hugging Face Inference API.
response = requests.post(
    "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {<YOUR HUGGING FACE API TOKEN>}"},
    json={
        "inputs": "Answer the following question like Paul Graham from YCombinator:\\n"
        "How should I think about competition for my startup?",
        "parameters": {
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "return_full_text": False,  # Otherwise, Hugging Face will return the prompt as part of the generation.
        },
    },
).json()

# Parse the output from the Hugging Face response.

output = response[0]["generated_text"]

# Log the inputs, outputs and model config to your project.

log_response = humanloop.log(
project=project_id,
inputs={"question": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"},
output=output,
model_config={
"model": "gpt2",
"prompt_template": "Answer the following question like Paul Graham from YCombinator:\\n{{question}}",

   [https://app.humanloop.com/signup].
 * You have a system making a series of LLM calls when a user makes a request. If you do not have one, you can use the following
   example Python script. In this guide, we'll be illustrating the steps to be taken with specific modifications to this script.

If you don't use Python, you can checkout our [Typescript SDK ](/reference/sdks) or the underlying API in our [Postman
collection](https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop/collection/12831443-49f7f148-f62a-4dd4-859a-7b4d000069de?action=share&creator=12831443)
for the corresponding endpoints.


EXAMPLE SCRIPT

"""
# Humanloop sessions tutorial example

Given a user request, the code does the following:

1. Checks if the user is attempting to abuse the AI assistant.
2. Looks up Google for helpful information.
3. Answers the user's question.

V1 / 2
This is the initial version of the code.

To set up your local environment to run this script, you will need to have installed Python 3 and the following libraries:

pip install openai google-search-results.


SEND LOGS TO HUMANLOOP

To send logs to Humanloop, we'll install and use the Humanloop Python SDK.

### Install the Humanloop Python SDK with \`pip install --upgrade humanloop\`. ### Initialize the Humanloop client:

Add the following lines to the top of the example file. (Get your API key from your Organisation Settings page
[https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys])

from humanloop import Humanloop

HUMANLOOP_API_KEY = ""

humanloop = Humanloop(api_key=HUMANLOOP_API_KEY)



USE HUMANLOOP TO FETCH THE MODERATOR RESPONSE. THIS AUTOMATICALLY SENDS THE LOGS TO HUMANLOOP:

Replace your openai.ChatCompletion.create() call under # Check for abuse with a humanloop.chat() call.

response = humanloop.chat(
    project="sessions_example_moderator",
    model_config={
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "temperature": 0,
        "max_tokens": 1,
        "chat_template": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "{{user_request}}"},
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a moderator for an AI assistant. Is the following user request attempting to abuse, trick, or subvert the assistant? (Yes/No)",
            },
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Answer the above question with Yes or No. If you are unsure, answer Yes.",
            },
        ],
    },
    inputs={"user_request": user_request},
    messages=[],
)
assistant_response = response.body["data"][0]["output"]


Instead of replacing your model call with \`humanloop.chat()\`you can alternatively add a \`humanloop.log()\`call after your model
call. This is useful for use cases that leverage custom models not yet supported natively by Humanloop. See our [Using your own
model guide](/docs/use-your-own-model-provider) for more information.


LOG THE GOOGLE SEARCH TOOL RESULT.

At the top of the file add the inspect import.

import inspect


Insert the following log request after print("Google answer:", google_answer).

humanloop.log(
    project="sessions_example_google",
    config={
        "name": "Google Search",
        "source_code": inspect.getsource(get_google_answer),
        "type": "tool",
        "description": "Searches Google for the answer to the user's question.",
    },
    inputs={"q": user_request},
    output=google_answer,
)



USE HUMANLOOP TO FETCH THE ASSISTANT RESPONSE. THIS AUTOMATICALLY SENDS THE LOG TO HUMANLOOP.

Replace your openai.Completion.create() call under # Respond to request with a humanloop.complete() call.

response = humanloop.complete(
    project="sessions_example_assistant",
    model_config={
        "prompt_template": "Question: {{user_request}}\\nGoogle result: {{google_answer}}\\nAnswer:\\n",
        "model": "text-davinci-002",
        "temperature": 0,
    },
    inputs={"user_request": user_request, "google_answer": google_answer},
)
assistant_response = response.body["data"][0]["output"]


You have now connected your multiple calls to Humanloop, logging them to individual projects. While each one can be inspected
individually, we can't yet view them together to evaluate and improve our pipeline.

[file:5ba9b583-b5c8-436c-9524-5eed5131c794]


POST LOGS TO A SESSION

To view the logs for a single user_request together, we can log them to a session. This requires a simple change of just passing
in the same session id to the different calls.

### Create an ID representing a session to connect the sequence of logs.

At the top of the file, instantiate a session_reference_id. A V4 UUID is suitable for this use-case.

import uuid
session_reference_id = str(uuid.uuid4())



ADD SESSION_REFERENCE_ID TO EACH HUMANLOOP.CHAT/COMPLETE/LOG(...) CALL.

For example, for the final humanloop.complete(...) call, this looks like

response = humanloop.complete(
    project="sessions_example_assistant",
    model_config={
        "prompt_template": "Question: {{user_request}}\\nGoogle result: {{google_answer}}\\nAnswer:\\n",
        "model": "text-davinci-002",
        "temperature": 0,
    },
    inputs={"user_request": user_request, "google_answer": google_answer},
    session_reference_id=session_reference_id,
)


[file:ecadd4fb-219d-4d17-abc8-0ba6e6e9ef4d]

SUBTITLE: >- THIS GUIDE SHOWS YOU HOW TO SET UP AN EXPERIMENT ON HUMANLOOP TO SYSTEMATICALLY FIND THE BEST-PERFORMING MODEL
CONFIGURATION FOR YOUR PROJECT BASED ON YOUR END-USERS’ FEEDBACK.

Experiments can be used to compare different prompt templates, different parameter combinations (such as temperature and presence
penalties) and even different base models.


PREREQUISITES

 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * You have integrated humanloop.complete_deployed() or the humanloop.chat_deployed() endpoints, along with the
   humanloop.feedback() with the API [https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop] or Python SDK
   [/docs/generate-and-log-with-the-sdk].

This guide assumes you're are using an OpenAI model. If you want to use other providers or your own model please also look at the
[guide for running an experiment with your own model provider](/docs/use-your-own-model-provider).


CREATE AN EXPERIMENT

### Navigate to the **Experiments** tab of your project. ### Click the **Create new experiment** button: 1. Give your experiment a
descriptive name. 2. Select a list of feedback labels to be considered as positive actions - this will be used to calculate the
performance of each of your model configs during the experiment. 3. Select which of your project’s model configs you wish to
compare. 4. Then click the **Create** button. [file:89eaee66-a989-4b03-ac2d-2f0a29c9ba2c]


SET THE EXPERIMENT LIVE

Now that you have an experiment, you need to set it as the project’s active experiment:

### Navigate to the **Experiments** tab. ### Click the **Experiment** card you want to deploy. ### Click the **Deploy** button
next to the Environments label. ### Select the environment to deploy the experiment. We only have one environment by default so
select the 'production' environment. [file:fb7e5ae9-677b-42ac-a614-0b49e8b465a5] Now that your experiment is active, any SDK or
API calls to generate will sample model configs from the list you provided when creating the experiment and any subsequent
feedback captured using feedback will contribute to the experiment performance.


MONITOR EXPERIMENT PROGRESS

Now that an experiment is live, the data flowing through your generate and feedback calls will update the experiment progress in
real time:

### Navigate back to the **Experiments** tab. ### Select the **Experiment** card.

Here you will see the performance of each model config with a measure of confidence based on how much feedback data has been
collected so far:

You can toggle on and off existing model configs and choose to add new model configs from your project over the lifecycle of an
experiment [file:e7077750-a764-4f1a-8ff4-21b3cc178cf9]

🎉 Your experiment can now give you insight into which of the model configs your users prefer.

How quickly you can draw conclusions depends on how much traffic you have flowing through your project.

Generally, you should be able to draw some initial conclusions after on the order of hundreds of examples.

SUBTITLE: HOW TO SET UP AN EXPERIMENT ON HUMANLOOP WITH YOUR OWN MODELS.

Experiments can be used to compare different prompt templates, different parameter combinations (such as temperature and presence
penalties) and even different base models.

This guide focuses on the case where you wish to manage your own model provider calls.


PREREQUISITES

 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * You have integrated humanloop.complete_deployed() or the humanloop.chat_deployed() endpoints, along with the
   humanloop.feedback() with the API [https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop] or Python SDK
   [/docs/generate-and-log-with-the-sdk].

This guide assumes you're are using an OpenAI model. If you want to use other providers or your own model please also look at the
[guide for running an experiment with your own model provider](/docs/use-your-own-model-provider).

Support for other model providers on Humanloop is coming soon.




CREATE AN EXPERIMENT

### Navigate to the **Experiments** tab of your project. ### Click the **Create new experiment** button: 1. Give your experiment a
descriptive name. 2. Select a list of feedback labels to be considered as positive actions - this will be used to calculate the
performance of each of your model configs during the experiment. 3. Select which of your project’s model configs you wish to
compare. Then click the **Create** button. [file:775f9b79-2b21-4fa5-906a-c45ac8f01644]


LOG TO YOUR EXPERIMENT

In order to log data for your experiment without using humanloop.complete_deployed() or humanloop.chat_deployed(), you must first
determine which model config to use for your LLM provider calls. This is where the humanloop.experiments.get_model_config()
function comes in.

### Go to your project dashboard and set the experiment as the active deployment. To do so, find the **default** environment in
the Deployments bar. Click the dropdown menu from the default environment and from those options select **Change deployment**. In
the dialog that opens select the experiment you created. [file:e11887c6-f099-4e20-9d3b-9552088b40f2]


COPY YOUR PROJECT_ID FROM THE URL, HTTPS://APP.HUMANLOOP.COM/PROJECTS/<PROJECT_ID>/DASHBOARD. THE PROJECT ID STARTS WITH PR_.


ALTER YOUR EXISTING LOGGING CODE TO NOW FIRST SAMPLE A MODEL_CONFIG FROM YOUR EXPERIMENT TO USE WHEN MAKING YOUR CALL TO OPENAI:

from humanloop import Humanloop
import openai 

# Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")

# Sample a model_config from your experiment.
model_config_response = humanloop.projects.get_active_config(id=project_id)
model_config = model_config_response.body["config"]

# Make a generation using OpenAI using the parameters from the sampled model_config.
response = openai.Completion.create(
    prompt="Answer the following question like Paul Graham from YCombinator:\\n"
    "How should I think about competition for my startup?",
    model=model_config["model"],
    temperature=model_config["temperature"],
)

# Parse the output from the OpenAI response.
output = response.choices[0].text

# Log the inputs and outputs to the experiment trial associated to the sampled model_config.
log_response = humanloop.log(
    project_id=project_id,
    inputs={"question": "How should I think about competition for my startup?"},
    output=output,
    trial_id=model_config["trial_id"],
)

# Use this ID to associate feedback received later to this log.
data_id = log_response.body["id"]


You can also run multiple experiments within a single project. In this case, first navigate to the Experiments tab of your project
and select your Experiment card. Then, retrieve your experiment_id from the experiment summary:

[file:83ebd144-d029-4bf4-b786-f8ec7f7b9b1e]

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE WE WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO USE HUMANLOOP’S FINE-TUNING WORKFLOW TO PRODUCE IMPROVED MODELS LEVERAGING
YOUR USER FEEDBACK DATA.


PREREQUISITES

 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * You have integrated humanloop.complete_deployed() or the humanloop.chat_deployed() endpoints, along with the
   humanloop.feedback() with the API [https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop] or Python SDK
   [/docs/generate-and-log-with-the-sdk].

A common question is how much data do I need to fine-tune effectively? Here we can reference the [OpenAI
guidelines](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning): > _The more training examples you have, the better. We recommend
having at least a couple hundred examples. In general, we've found that each doubling of the dataset size leads to a linear
increase in model quality._


FINE-TUNING

The first part of fine-tuning is to select the data you wish to fine-tune on.

### Go to your Humanloop project and navigate to **Logs** tab. ### Create a **filter** (using the **+ Filter** button above the
table) of the logs you would like to fine-tune on.

For example, all the logs that have received a positive upvote in the feedback captured from your end users.

[file:9715cae5-0819-4454-80cb-29b8e7a13c64]


CLICK THE ACTIONS BUTTON, THEN CLICK THE NEW FINE-TUNED MODEL BUTTON TO SET UP THE FINETUNING PROCESS.


ENTER THE APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS FOR THE FINE-TUNED MODEL.

 1. Enter a Model name. This will be used as the suffix parameter in OpenAI’s fine-tune interface. For example, a suffix of
    "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like ada:ft-your-org:custom-model-name-2022-02-15-04-21-04.
 2. Choose the Base model to fine-tune. This can be ada, babbage, curie, or davinci.
 3. Select a Validation split percentage. This is the proportion of data that will be used for validation. Metrics will be
    periodically calculated against the validation data during training.
 4. Enter a Data snapshot name. Humanloop associates a data snapshot to every fine-tuned model instance so it is easy to keep
    track of what data is used (you can see yourexisting data snapshots on the Settings/Data snapshots page)

SUBTITLE: HOW TO INVITE COLLABORATORS TO YOUR HUMANLOOP ORGANIZATION.

Inviting people to your organization allows them to interact with your Humanloop projects:

 * Teammates will be able to create new model configs and experiments
 * Developers will be able to get an API key to interact with projects through the SDK
 * Annotators may provide feedback on logged datapoints using the Data tab (in addition to feedback captured from your end-users
   via the SDK feedback integration)


PREREQUISITES

 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.


INVITE USERS

To invite users to your organization:

### Go to your organization's **[Members page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/members)**. ### Enter the **email address** of
the person you wish to invite into the **Invite members** box. [file:b32a8cd3-ccfb-4b19-b6eb-708d0cf24fe2]


CLICK SEND INVITE.

An email will be sent to the entered email address, inviting them to the organization. If the entered email address is not already
a Humanloop user, they will be prompted to create an account before being added to the organization.

SUBTITLE: IN THIS GUIDE WE WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO CREATE AND USE ENVIRONMENTS.

Environments enable you to deploy model configurations and experiments, making them accessible via API, while also maintaining a
streamlined production workflow. These environments are created at the organizational level and can be utilized on a per-project
basis. For detailed information on environments, please refer to our Changelog [/reference/changelog].

Only Enterprise customers can create more than one environment


CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT

### Go to your Organization's [Environments](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments) page.


CLICK THE + ENVIRONMENT BUTTON TO OPEN THE NEW ENVIRONMENT DIALOG.


ASSIGN A CUSTOM NAME TO THE ENVIRONMENT.


CLICK CREATE.

[file:57121ad6-925a-406d-aec5-fda515b3a756]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DEPLOYING TO AN ENVIRONMENT


PREREQUISITES

 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * Ensure that your project has existing model configs that you wish to use.

To deploy a model config to an environment:

### Navigate to the **Dashboard** of your project.


CLICK THE DROPDOWN MENU OF THE ENVIRONMENT

[file:2510b890-c88f-4dd0-bf63-d971ba4549c8]


CLICK THE CHANGE DEPLOYMENT BUTTON


SELECT A VERSION

From the model configs or experiments within that project click on the one that you wish to deploy to the target environment

[file:08d31912-9406-46b7-8801-b8344bc589cd]


CLICK THE DEPLOY BUTTON.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CALLING THE MODEL IN THE ENVIRONMENT


PREREQUISITES

 * You have already deployed either a chat or completion model config - if not, please follow the steps in either the Generate
   chat responses [/docs/chat-using-the-sdk] or Generate completions [/docs/completion-using-the-sdk] guides.
 * You have multiple environments, with a model config deployed in a non-default environment. See the Deploying to an environment
   section above.

The following steps are assuming you're using an OpenAI model and that you're calling a \`chat\` workflow. The steps needed to
target a specific environment for a \`completion\` workflow are similar. ### Navigate to the **Models** tab of your Humanloop
project. ### Click the dropdown menu of the environment you wish to use. ### Click the **Use API** menu option. A dialog will open
with code snippets. Select the language you wish to use (e.g. Python, TypeScript). The value of \`environment\` parameter is the
name of environment you wish to target via the chat-deployed call. An example of this can be seen in the code below.

import os
from humanloop import Humanloop

HUMANLOOP_API_KEY = os.getenv("HUMANLOOP_API_KEY")

humanloop = Humanloop(api_key=HUMANLOOP_API_KEY)

response = humanloop.chat_deployed(
    project="YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    inputs={},
    messages=[{ "role": "user", "content": "Tell a joke" }],
    provider_api_keys={
        "openai": "OPENAI_KEY_HERE"
    },
    environment="YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME"
)

print(response.body["data"][0]["output"])

UPDATING THE DEFAULT ENVIRONMENT

Only Enterprise customers can update their default environment


PREREQUISITES

 * You have multiple environments - if not first go through the Create an environment [/docs/deploy-to-an-environment] section.

Every organization will have a default environment. This can be updated by the following:

### Go to your Organization's [Environment](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments) page.


CLICK ON THE DROPDOWN MENU OF AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT ALREADY THE DEFAULT.


CLICK THE MAKE DEFAULT OPTION

A dialog will open asking you if you are certain this is a change you want to make. If so, click the Make default button.


VERIFY THE DEFAULT TAG HAS MOVED TO THE ENVIRONMENT YOU SELECTED.

SUBTITLE: >- DATASETS CAN BE CREATED FROM EXISTING LOGS OR UPLOADED FROM CSV AND VIA THE API.

You can currently create datasets in Humanloop in three ways: from existing logs, by uploading a CSV or via the API.


CONVERT FROM EXISTING LOGS

Prerequisites:

 * A project [/docs/projects-2] in Humanloop
 * Some logged generations [/docs/generate-and-log-with-the-sdk] available in that project

To create a dataset from existing logs:

### Go to the **Logs** tab in your project ### Select a subset of the logs in that project and choose **Add to dataset** from the
menu in the top right of the page. Select some logs and then click **Add to Dataset** [file:69c20bbb-87c1-4952-ae25-d22970d759d5]


IN THE DIALOG BOX, PROVIDE A NAME AND DESCRIPTION FOR THE NEW DATASET. ALTERNATIVELY, YOU CAN CLICK ADD TO EXISTING DATASET TO
APPEND THE SELECTED TO A DATASET YOU ALREADY HAVE.


UPLOAD FROM CSV

Prerequisites:

 * A project [/docs/projects-2] in Humanloop

To create a dataset from a CSV file, we'll first create a CSV in Google Sheets and then upload it to a dataset in Humanloop.

### Create a CSV file. - In our Google Sheets example below, we have a column called \`user_query\` which is an input to a prompt
variable of that name. So in our model config, we'll need to include \`{{ user_query }}\` somewhere, and that placeholder will be
populated with the value from the \`user_query\` input in the datapoint at generation-time. - You can include as many columns of
prompt variables as you need for your model configs. - There is additionally a column called \`target\` which will populate the
target of the datapoint. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target. - Note: \`messages\` are harder to incorporate
into a CSV file as they tend to be verbose and hard-to-read JSON. If you want a dataset with messages, consider using the API to
upload, or convert from existing logs. A CSV file in Google Sheets defining a collection of 9 datapoints.
[file:11ce86bc-18d2-4b20-b550-cf760eafeba2]


EXPORT THE GOOGLE SHEET TO CSV BY CHOOSING FILE → DOWNLOAD → COMMA-SEPARATED VALUES (.CSV)


IN YOUR HUMANLOOP PROJECT, GO TO THE DATASETS TAB AND CHOOSE NEW DATASET


IN THE DIALOG WINDOW, PROVIDE A NAME AND OPTIONAL DESCRIPTION FOR THE DATASET. THEN UPLOAD THE CSV FILE FROM STEP 2 BY
DRAG-AND-DROP OR USING THE FILE EXPLORER.

Uploading a CSV file to create a dataset. [file:1234d04a-7675-4497-8d6e-48ecba04fbe1]


CLICK UPLOAD DATASET FROM CSV AND YOU SHOULD SEE A NEW DATASET APPEAR IN THE DATASETS TAB. YOU CAN EXPLORE IT BY CLICKING IN.


FOLLOW THE LINK IN THE POP-UP TO INSPECT THE DATASET THAT WAS CREATED IN THE UPLOAD. YOU'LL SEE A COLUMN WITH THE INPUT KEY-VALUE
PAIRS FOR EACH DATAPOINT, A MESSAGES COLUMN (IN OUR CASE WE DIDN'T USE MESSAGES, SO THEY'RE ALL EMPTY) AND A TARGET COLUMN WITH
THE EXPECTED MODEL OUTPUT.

[file:eca4b2bb-e174-4c74-87a8-e28e21e3b030]


UPLOAD VIA API

### First define some sample data as a basis for your test datapoints, consisting of user messages and target extraction pairs.
This is where you could load up any existing data you wish to use for your evaluation:

# Example test case data
data = [
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hi Humanloop support team, I'm having trouble understanding how to use the evaluations feature in your software. Can you provide a step-by-step guide or any resources to help me get started?",
            }
        ],
        "target": {"feature": "evaluations", "issue": "needs step-by-step guide"},
    },
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hi there, I'm interested in fine-tuning a language model using your software. Can you explain the process and provide any best practices or guidelines?",
            }
        ],
        "target": {
            "feature": "fine-tuning",
            "issue": "process explanation and best practices",
        },
    },
]



THEN DEFINE A DATASET AND UPLOAD THE DATAPOINTS

# Create a dataset
dataset = humanloop.datasets.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    name="Sample dataset",
    description="Examples of featue requests extracted from user messages",
)
dataset_id = dataset.body["id"]

# Create datapoints for the dataset
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.create_datapoint(
    dataset_id=dataset_id,
    body=data,
)


On the datasets tab in your Humanloop project you will now see the dataset you just uploaded via the API.

CREATE A MODEL CONFIG

It's important that the model config we use to perform the batch generation is consistent with the dataset. We're going to use the
simple customer support dataset that we uploaded in the previous Create a dataset guide [/docs/create-a-dataset]. As a reminder,
the dataset looks like this

The underlying data for our \`customer_queries\` dataset. [file:11ce86bc-18d2-4b20-b550-cf760eafeba2]

We want to get the model to classify the customer support query into the appropriate category. For this dataset, we have specified
the correct category for each datapoint, so we'll be able to know easily if the model produced the correct output.

### In Editor, create a simple completion model config as below. [file:10156654-f688-4e35-bc1d-2d3446b12f7d]

We've used the following prompt:

You are a customer support classifier for Humanloop, a platform for building applications with LLMs.

Please classify the following customer support query into one of these categories: [datasets, docs, evaluators, feedback,
fine-tuning, model configs, model providers]

{{user_query}}

The most important thing here is that we have included a prompt variable - {{ user_query }} which corresponds to the input key on
all the datapoints in our dataset. This was the first column header in the CSV file we used to upload the dataset.


SAVE THE MODEL CONFIG BY CLICKING THE SAVE BUTTON. CALL THE CONFIG SUPPORT_CLASSIFIER.


GO TO THE DATASETS TAB


CLICK THE MENU ICON IN THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER OF THE DATASET YOU WANT TO PERFORM A BATCH GENERATION ACROSS.


IN THAT MENU, CHOOSE BATCH GENERATE & EVAL

Trigger a batch generation on a dataset from this menu. [file:78d13c04-45c8-4acc-b8c4-f21433212492]


IN THE DIALOG WINDOW, CHOOSE THE SUPPORT_CLASSIFIER MODEL CONFIG CREATED IN STEP 2.


YOU CAN ALSO OPTIONALLY SELECT AN EVALUATOR TO USE TO COMPARE THE MODEL'S GENERATION OUTPUT TO THE TARGET OUTPUT IN EACH
DATAPOINT. WE SET UP THE EXACT MATCH OFFLINE EVALUATOR IN OUR PROJECT (IT'S ONE OF THE BUILTINS AND REQUIRES NO FURTHER
CONFIGURATION).


CLICK BATCH GENERATE


FOLLOW THE LINK IN THE POP-UP TO THE BATCH GENERATION RUN WHICH IS UNDER THE EVALUATIONS TAB.

When you run an offline evaluation, Humanloop iterates through each datapoint in the dataset and triggers a fresh LLM generation using the inputs of the testcase and the model config being evaluated. For each test case, your evaluator function will be called, taking as arguments the freshly generated \`log\` and the \`testcase\` datapoint that gave rise to it.

SUBTITLE: >- HUMANLOOP'S EVALUATION FRAMEWORK ALLOWS YOU TO TEST AND TRACK THE PERFORMANCE OF MODELS IN A RIGOROUS WAY.

A key part of successful prompt engineering and deployment for LLMs is a robust evaluation framework. In this section we provide
guides for how to set up Humanloop's evaluation framework in your projects.

The core entity in the Humanloop evaluation framework is an evaluator - a function you define which takes an LLM-generated log as
an argument and returns an evaluation. The evaluation is typically either a boolean or a number, indicating how well the model
performed according to criteria you determine based on your use case.


TYPES

Currently, you can define your evaluators in two different ways:

 * Python - using our in-browser editor, define simple Python functions to act as evaluators
 * LLM - use language models to evaluate themselves! Our evaluator editor allows you to define a special-purpose prompt which
   passes data from the underlying log to a language model. This type of evaluation is particularly useful for more subjective
   evaluation such as verifying appropriate tone-of-voice or factuality given an input set of facts.


MODES: MONITORING VS. TESTING

Evaluation is useful for both testing new model configs as you develop them and for monitoring live deployments that are already
in production.

To handle these different use cases, there are two distinct modes of evaluator - online and offline.


ONLINE

Online evaluators are for use on logs generated in your project, including live in production. Typically, they are used to monitor
deployed model performance over time.

Online evaluators can be set to run automatically whenever logs are added to a project. The evaluator takes the log as an
argument.


OFFLINE

Offline evaluators are for use with predefined test datasets [/docs/datasets] in order to evaluate models as you iterate in your
prompt engineering workflow, or to test for regressions in a CI environment.

A test dataset is a collection of datapoints, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming.
Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.

When you run an offline evaluation, Humanloop iterates through each datapoint in the dataset and triggers a fresh LLM generation
using the inputs of the testcase and the model config being evaluated. For each test case, your evaluator function will be called,
taking as arguments the freshly generated log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it. Typically, you would write your
evaluator to perform some domain-specific logic to determine whether the model-generated log meets your desired criteria (as
specified in the datapoint 'target').


HUMANLOOP-HOSTED VS. SELF-HOSTED

Conceptually, evaluation runs have two components:

 1. Generation of logs from the datapoints
 2. Evaluating those logs.

Using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted.
Similarly, evaluations of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app) or
self-hosted (see our guide on self-hosted evaluations [/docs/self-hosted-evaluations]).

In fact, it's possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime generations and evaluations in any combination you wish.
When creating an evaluation via the API, set the hl_generated flag to False to indicate that you are posting the logs from your
own infrastructure (see our guide on evaluating externally-generated logs [/docs/evaluating-externally-generated-logs]). Include
an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure. You can include
multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include any combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime
evaluators.",

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO CREATE AND USE ONLINE EVALUATORS TO OBSERVE THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR MODELS.


CREATE AN ONLINE EVALUATOR


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations.
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * Finally, you need at least a few logs in your project. Use the Editor to generate some logs if you don't have any yet.

To set up an online Python evaluator:

### Go to the **Evaluations** page in one of your projects and select the **Evaluators** tab ### Select **+ New Evaluator** and
choose **Code Evaluator** in the dialog Selecting the type of a new evaluator [file:95410e92-c62c-4a43-b834-82d13c4d454e]


FROM THE LIBRARY OF PRESETS ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE, WE'LL CHOOSE VALID JSON FOR THIS GUIDE. YOU'LL SEE A PRE-POPULATED EVALUATOR
WITH PYTHON CODE THAT CHECKS THE OUTPUT OF OUR MODEL IS VALID JSON GRAMMAR.

The evaluator editor after selecting **Valid JSON** preset [file:d373e6bc-fe4f-4bc1-a705-ae59d3a5fd2d]


IN THE DEBUG CONSOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIALOG, CLICK RANDOM LOGS FROM PROJECT. THE CONSOLE WILL BE POPULATED WITH FIVE
DATAPOINTS FROM YOUR PROJECT.

The debug console (you can resize this area to make it easier to view the logs) [file:a5e38568-ef8e-4965-947e-bc90a5fee25c]


CLICK THE RUN BUTTON AT THE FAR RIGHT OF ONE OF THE LOG ROWS. AFTER A MOMENT, YOU'LL SEE THE RESULT COLUMN POPULATED WITH A TRUE
OR FALSE.

The **Valid JSON** evaluator returned \`True\` for this particular log, indicating the text output by the model was grammatically
correct JSON. [file:52b511f8-06a9-4e9c-a5c5-959a8e2d66d4]


EXPLORE THE LOG DICTIONARY IN THE TABLE TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE PYTHON OBJECT PASSED INTO THE EVALUATOR.


CLICK CREATE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PAGE.


ACTIVATE AN EVALUATOR FOR A PROJECT

### On the new **Valid JSON ** evaluator in the Evaluations tab, toggle the switch to **on** - the evaluator is now activated for
the current project. Activating the new evaluator to run automatically on your project.
[file:ee163762-793d-4338-8353-6b970cf9729f]


GO TO THE EDITOR, AND GENERATE SOME FRESH LOGS WITH YOUR MODEL.


OVER IN THE LOGS TAB YOU'LL SEE THE NEW LOGS. THE VALID JSON EVALUATOR RUNS AUTOMATICALLY ON THESE NEW LOGS, AND THE RESULTS ARE
DISPLAYED IN THE TABLE.

The **Logs** table includes a column for each activated evaluator in your project. Each activated evaluator runs on any new logs
in the project. [file:07310777-ca35-4b04-821a-4b541b88ae19]


TRACK THE PERFORMANCE OF MODELS


PREREQUISITES

 * A Humanloop project with a reasonable amount of data.
 * An Evaluator activated in that project.

To track the performance of different model configs in your project:

### Go to the **Dashboard** tab. ### In the table of model configs at the bottom, choose a subset of the project's model configs.
### Use the graph controls at the top of the page to select the date range and time granularity of interest. ### Review the
relative performance of the model configs for each activated Evaluator shown in the graphs.
[file:dcb37a23-00ae-4047-bb4c-2e02000396c4]


NOTE: AVAILABLE MODULES

The following Python modules are available to be imported in your code evaluators:

 * math
 * random
 * datetime
 * json (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)
 * jsonschema (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)
 * sqlglot (useful for validating SQL query grammar)
 * requests (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get
   started).",

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE WILL WALK THROUGH CREATING A TESTSET AND USING IT TO RUN AN OFFLINE EVALUATION.


CREATE AN OFFLINE EVALUATOR


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations.
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * Finally, you need at least a few logs in your project. Use the Editor to generate some logs if you don't have any yet.

You need logs in your project because we will use these a source of test datapoints for the dataset we will create. If you want to
create arbitrary test datapoints from scratch, see our guide to doing this from the API. We will soon be updating the app to
enable arbitrary test datapoint creation from your browser.

For this example, we're going to evaluate a model who's responsibility is to extract key information from a customer service
request and return this information in JSON. In the image below, you can see the model config we've drafted on the left, and an
example of it running against a customer query on the right.

[file:52cea3a3-4264-4df7-9a5d-fbd6a9a407f6]


SET UP A DATASET

We will create a dataset based on existing logs that are already in the project.

### Navigate to the **Logs** tab ### Select the logs you would like to convert into test datapoints ### From the dropdown menu in
the top right (see below), choose **Add to Dataset** Creating test datapoints from a selection of existing project datapoints.
[file:828f2ebf-b95f-42fb-906b-58b434e0ef4d]


IN THE DIALOG BOX, GIVE THE NEW DATASET A NAME AND PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL DESCRIPTION. CLICK CREATE DATASET.

[file:ca2707be-9d72-4a4d-a908-e8af3d4fdac0] You can add more datapoints to the same dataset later by clicking the 'add to existing
dataset' button at the top.


GO TO THE DATASETS TAB.


CLICK INTO THE NEWLY CREATED DATASET. ONE DATAPOINT WILL BE PRESENT FOR EACH LOG YOU SELECTED IN STEP 3

The newly created dataset, containing datapoints that were converted from existing logs in the project.
[file:e63fec0a-d870-4b92-bdd9-4d1c136a9282]


CLICK ON A DATAPOINT TO INSPECT ITS PARAMETERS.

A test datapoint contains inputs (the variables passed into your model config template), an optional sequence of messages (if used
for a chat model) and a target representing the desired output.

As we converted existing logs into datapoints, the target defaults to the output of the source log.



In our example, we created datapoints from existing logs. The default behaviour is that the original log's output becomes an
output field in the target JSON.

In order to access the feature field more easily in our evaluator, we'll modify the datapoint targets to be a raw JSON with a
feature key.

The original log was an LLM generation which outputted a JSON value. The conversion process has placed this into the \`output\`
field of the testcase target. [file:339aec12-b3c1-46cf-a500-001c4632ee27]


MODIFY THE DATAPOINT IF YOU NEED TO MAKE REFINEMENTS. YOU CAN PROVIDE AN ARBITRARY JSON OBJECT AS THE TARGET.

After editing, we have a clean JSON object recording the salient characteristics of the datapoint's expected output.
[file:66ad64ad-1ffe-4af9-9d4a-eded20b7e454]


CREATE AN OFFLINE EVALUATOR

Having set up a dataset, we'll now create the evaluator. As with online evaluators, it's a Python function but for offline mode,
it also takes a testcase parameter alongside the generated log.

### Navigate to the evaluations section, and then the Evaluators tab ### Select **+ New Evaluator** and choose **Offline
Evaluation** ### Choose **Start from scratch**

For this example, we'll use the code below to compare the LLM generated output with what we expected for that testcase.

import json
from json import JSONDecodeError

def it_extracts_correct_feature(log, testcase):
    expected_feature = testcase["target"]["feature"]

    try:
        # The model is expected to produce valid JSON output
        # but it could fail to do so.
        output = json.loads(log["output"])
        actual_feature = output.get("feature", None)
        return expected_feature == actual_feature

    except JSONDecodeError:
        # If the model didn't even produce valid JSON, then
        # we evaluate the output as bad.
        return False



IN THE DEBUG CONSOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIALOG, CLICK LOAD DATA AND THEN DATAPOINTS FROM DATASET. SELECT THE DATASET YOU CREATED
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION. THE CONSOLE WILL BE POPULATED WITH ITS DATAPOINTS.

The debug console. Use this to load up test datapoints from a dataset and perform debug runs with any model config in your
project. [file:c8c11918-92da-4e29-a8b5-5193ea359008]


CHOOSE A MODEL CONFIG FROM THE DROPDOWN MENU.


CLICK THE RUN BUTTON AT THE FAR RIGHT OF ONE OF THE TEST DATAPOINTS.

A new debug run will be triggered, which causes an LLM generation using that datapoint's inputs and messages parameters. The
generated log and the test datapoint will be passed into the evaluator and the resulting evaluation displays in the Result column.


CLICK CREATE WHEN YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THE EVALUATOR.


TRIGGER AN OFFLINE EVALUATION

Now that you have an offline evaluator and a dataset, you can use them to evaluate the performance of any model config in your
project.

### Go to the **Evaluations** section. ### In the **Runs** tab, click **Run Evaluation** ### In the dialog box, choose a model
config to evaluate, and select your newly created dataset and evaluator. [file:bb9a12b5-468d-4567-bbc1-4e407c678744]


CLICK BATCH GENERATE


A NEW EVALUATION IS LAUNCHED. CLICK ON THE CARD TO INSPECT THE RESULTS.

A batch generation has now been triggered. This means that the model config you selected will be used to generate a log for each
datapoint in the dataset. It may take some time for the evaluation to complete, depending on how many test datapoints are in your
dataset and what model config you are using. Once all the logs have been generated, the evaluator will execute for each in turn.


INSPECT THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION.

## Create evaluation

We'll go through how to use the SDK in a Python script to set up a project, create a testset and then finally trigger an evaluation.

### Set up a project


### Import Humanloop and set your [Humanloop](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) keys.

}
],
)
config_id = model_config.body["config"]["id"]

\`\`\`

If you log onto your Humanloop account you will now see your project with a single model config defined:





### Create a dataset

Follow the steps in our guide to [Upload a Dataset via API](/docs/create-a-dataset#upload-via-api).


### Now test your model manually by generating a log for one of the datapoints' messages:

\`\`\`python",
    "indexSegmentId": "v4.0-constant",
    "slug": "docs/set-up-evaluations-using-api#create-the-first-model-config-for-the-project-which-will-automatically-be-deployed",
    "title": "Create the first model config for the project, which will automatically be deployed",

      {
        "slug": "docs/set-up-evaluations-using-api#generate-a-log",
        "title": "Generate a log",
      },
    ],
    "content": "log = humanloop.chat_deployed(
project_id=project_id,
messages=data[0]["messages"],
inputs={"features": "evaluations, experiments, fine-tuning"},
).body["data"][0]

import json
print(json.dumps(log))
\`\`\`

You can see from the \`output\` field in the response that the model has done a good job at extracting the mentioned features in the desired json format:

\`\`\`json
{
"id": "data_aVUA2QZPHaQTnhoOCG7yS",
"model_config_id": "config_RbbfjXOkEnzYK6PS8cS96",
"messages": [

"role": "system",

},
{

}
],
"output": "{\\"feature\\": \\"evaluations\\", \\"issue\\": \\"trouble understanding how to use the evaluations feature\\"}",
"finish_reason": "stop"
}
\`\`\`



### Create an evaluator

Now that you have a project with a model config and a dataset defined, you can create an evaluator that will determine the success criteria for a log generated from the model using the target defined in the test datapoint.


### Create an evaluator to determine if the extracted JSON is correct and test it against the generated log and the corresponding test datapoint:

description="Validate that the json returned by the model matches the target json",
code=evaluator_code,
arguments_type="target_required",

)
evaluator_id = evaluator.body["id"]
\`\`\`

In your Humanloop project you will now see an evaluator defined:





### Launch an evaluation


### You can now launch an evaluation against the model config using the dataset and evaluator. In practise you can include more than one evaluator:

    "indexSegmentId": "v4.0-constant",
    "slug": "docs/set-up-evaluations-using-api#send-evaluator-to-humanloop",

    "type": "markdown-section-v1",
  },

        "slug": "docs/set-up-evaluations-using-api",

      {
        "slug": "docs/set-up-evaluations-using-api#finally-trigger-an-evaluation",
        "title": "Finally trigger an evaluation",
      },
    ],
    "content": "evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.create(
project_id=project_id,
evaluator_ids=[evaluator_id],
config_id=config_id,
dataset_id=dataset_id,
)
\`\`\`

Navigate to your Humanloop account to see the evaluation results. Initially it will be in a pending state, but will quickly move to completed given the small number of test cases. The datapoints generated by your model as part of the evaluation will also be recorded in your project's logs table.

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE'LL WALK THROUGH AN EXAMPLE OF USING OUR API TO CREATE TESTSETS AND TRIGGER AN EVALUATION.


PREREQUISITES:

 * You need to have access to the beta preview of evaluations.

This guide uses our [Python SDK](/reference/sdks). All of the endpoints used are available in our [Typescript
SDK](/reference/sdks) and directly [via the API](/reference/humanloop-api).


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

First you need to install and initialize the SDK, which requires Python 3.8 or greater. If you have already set this up, skip to
the next section. Otherwise, open up your terminal and follow these steps:

### Install the Humanloop Python SDK: We recommend pinning your installed Humanloop SDK to a specific version so that changes
don't cause issues. \`\`\`shell pip install humanloop \`\`\` ### Start a Python interpreter: \`\`\`shell python \`\`\` ### Test your
installation by running: \`\`\`python >>> from humanloop import Humanloop \`\`\`


CREATE EVALUATION

We'll go through how to use the SDK in a Python script to set up a project, create a testset and then finally trigger an
evaluation.


SET UP A PROJECT

### Import Humanloop and set your [Humanloop](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) and [OpenAI
API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) keys.

from humanloop import Humanloop

HUMANLOOP_API_KEY = "<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<YOUR OPENAI KEY>"

# Initialize the Humanloop client
humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key=HUMANLOOP_API_KEY,
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
)



CREATE A PROJECT AND REGISTER YOUR FIRST MODEL CONFIG - WE'LL USE OPENAI'S GPT-4 FOR EXTRACTING PRODUCT FEATURE NAMES FROM
CUSTOMER QUERIES IN THIS EXAMPLE. THE FIRST MODEL CONFIG CREATED AGAINST THE PROJECT IS AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYED:


# Create a project
project = humanloop.projects.create(name="evals-guide")
project_id = project.body["id"]

# Create the first model config for the project, which will automatically be deployed
model_config = humanloop.model_configs.register(
    project_id=project_id,
    model="gpt-4",
    name="Entity extractor v0",
    endpoint="chat",
    chat_template=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "Extract the name of the feature or issue the customer is describing. "
            "Possible features are only: evaluations, experiments, fine-tuning \\n"
            "Write your response in json format as follows:"
            ' \\n {"feature": "feature requested", "issue": "description of issue"}',
        }
    ],
)
config_id = model_config.body["config"]["id"]


If you log onto your Humanloop account you will now see your project with a single model config defined:

[file:d2e4e610-f3a4-4ff0-b8a8-16751a0ed5df]


CREATE A DATASET

Follow the steps in our guide to Upload a Dataset via API [/docs/create-a-dataset#upload-via-api].

### Now test your model manually by generating a log for one of the datapoints' messages:

# Generate a log
log = humanloop.chat_deployed(
    project_id=project_id,
    messages=data[0]["messages"],
    inputs={"features": "evaluations, experiments, fine-tuning"},
).body["data"][0]

import json
print(json.dumps(log))


You can see from the output field in the response that the model has done a good job at extracting the mentioned features in the
desired json format:

{
  "id": "data_aVUA2QZPHaQTnhoOCG7yS",
  "model_config_id": "config_RbbfjXOkEnzYK6PS8cS96",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Extract the name of the feature or issue the customer is describing. Possible features are only: evaluations, experiments, fine-tuning \\nWrite your response in json format as follows: \\n {\\"feature\\": \\"feature requested\\", \\"issue\\": \\"description of issue\\"}"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hi Humanloop support team, I'm having trouble understanding how to use the evaluations feature in your software. Can you provide a step-by-step guide or any resources to help me get started?"
    }
  ],
  "output": "{\\"feature\\": \\"evaluations\\", \\"issue\\": \\"trouble understanding how to use the evaluations feature\\"}",
  "finish_reason": "stop"
}



CREATE AN EVALUATOR

Now that you have a project with a model config and a dataset defined, you can create an evaluator that will determine the success
criteria for a log generated from the model using the target defined in the test datapoint.

### Create an evaluator to determine if the extracted JSON is correct and test it against the generated log and the corresponding
test datapoint:

# Define an evaluator
import json
from json import JSONDecodeError


def check_feature_json(datapoint, testcase):
    expected_feature = testcase["target"]["feature"]

    try:
        # The model is expected to produce valid JSON output but it could fail to do so.
        output = json.loads(datapoint["output"])
        actual_feature = output.get("feature", None)
        return expected_feature == actual_feature
    except JSONDecodeError:
        # If the model didn't even produce valid JSON, then it fails
        return False

# Try out the evalutor
print(f"Test case result: {check_feature_json(datapoint, data[0])}")


Test case result: True



SUBMIT THIS EVALUATOR TO HUMANLOOP SO IT CAN BE USED FOR FUTURE EVALUATIONS TRIGGERED VIA THE UI OR THE API:

import inspect

# The evaluator must be sent as a string, so we convert it first
json_imports = "import json\\nfrom json import JSONDecodeError\\n"
evaluator_code = json_imports + inspect.getsource(check_feature_json)

# Send evaluator to Humanloop
evaluator = humanloop.evaluators.create(
    name="Feature request json",
    description="Validate that the json returned by the model matches the target json",
    code=evaluator_code,
    arguments_type="target_required",
    return_type="boolean",
)
evaluator_id = evaluator.body["id"]


In your Humanloop project you will now see an evaluator defined:

[file:cdf5888d-fa95-4b11-99a4-24debd49488b]


LAUNCH AN EVALUATION

### You can now launch an evaluation against the model config using the dataset and evaluator. In practise you can include more
than one evaluator:

# Finally trigger an evaluation
evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    evaluator_ids=[evaluator_id],
    config_id=config_id,
    dataset_id=dataset_id,
)


Navigate to your Humanloop account to see the evaluation results. Initially it will be in a pending state, but will quickly move
to completed given the small number of test cases. The datapoints generated by your model as part of the evaluation will also be
recorded in your project's logs table.

[file:78616a39-a2e9-480c-889e-2d8fc6b0861e]

Here is the full script you can copy and paste and run in your Python environment:

project_id = project.body["id"]

# Create the first model config for the project, which will automatically be deployed

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE WILL SET UP AN LLM EVALUATOR TO CHECK FOR PII (PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION) IN LOGS.

As well as using Python code to evaluate logs, you can also create special-purpose prompts for LLMs to evaluate logs too.

In this guide, we'll show how to set up LLM evaluations.


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations.
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * Finally, you need at least a few logs in your project. Use the Editor to generate some logs if you don't have any yet.


SET UP AN LLM EVALUATOR

### From the Evaluations page, click **New Evaluator** and select AI. [file:4edafc15-f7e0-4b28-a9a4-0fa49812d2f4]


FROM THE PRESETS MENU ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE, SELECT PII.

[file:a0d28f7e-6d92-457b-ab65-90c1ec4bc3f3]


SET THE EVALUATOR TO ONLINE MODE, AND TOGGLE AUTO-RUN TO ON. THIS WILL MAKE THE PII CHECKER RUN ON ALL NEW LOGS IN THE PROJECT.

The **PII check** evaluator. [file:2cb93e11-11ec-47be-97a8-0781b71733c0]


CLICK CREATE IN THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE PAGE.


GO TO EDITOR AND TRY GENERATING A COUPLE OF LOGS, SOME CONTAINING PII AND SOME WITHOUT.


GO TO THE LOGS TABLE TO REVIEW THESE LOGS.

The logs table, showing that the **PII check** evaluator ran on the latest logs. [file:96ab3aef-7fd6-452e-982b-5f5e5917f25b]


CLICK ONE OF THE LOGS TO SEE MORE DETAILS IN THE DRAWER. IN OUR EXAMPLE BELOW, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE LOG DID CONTAIN PII, AND
THE PII CHECK EVALUATOR HAS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED THIS AND FLAGGED IT WITH FALSE.

[file:3c55afa3-3106-4c20-8fa3-1a5f4003ef3b]


CLICK VIEW SESSION AT THE TOP OF LOG DRAWER TO INSPECT IN MORE DETAIL THE LLM EVALUATOR'S GENERATION ITSELF.


SELECT THE PII CHECK ENTRY IN THE SESSION TRACE. IN THE COMPLETED PROMPT TAB OF THE LOG, YOU'LL SEE THE FULL INPUT AND OUTPUT OF
THE LLM EVALUATOR GENERATION.

The LLM evaluator produced an explanation reasoning why the underlying log did contain PII, and terminated with a final verdict of
'False'. [file:d81297a6-8d1c-4b5a-b521-0e7aefc56599]


AVAILABLE VARIABLES

In the prompt editor for an LLM evaluator, you have access to the underlying log you are evaluating as well as the testcase that
gave rise to it in the case of offline evaluations. These are accessed with the standard {{ variable }} syntax, enhanced with a
familiar dot notation to pick out specific values from inside the log and testcase objects. The log and testcase shown in the
debug console correspond to the objects available in the context of the LLM evaluator prompt.

For example, suppose you are evaluating a log object like this.

{
    "id": "data_B3RmIu9aA5FibdtXP7CkO",
    "model_config": {...},
    "inputs": {
        "hello": "world",
    },
    "messages": []
    "output": "This is what the AI responded with.",
    ...etc
}


In the LLM evaluator prompt, if you write {{ log.inputs.hello }} it will be replaced with world in the final prompt sent to the
LLM evaluator model.

Note that in order to get access to the fully populated prompt that was sent in the underlying log, you can use {{ log_prompt }}.",

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE'LL SHOW HOW TO RUN AN EVALUATION IN YOUR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE AND POST THE RESULTS TO HUMANLOOP.

For some use cases, you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, as opposed to running the evaluators we
offer in our Humanloop runtime.

For example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model or which has to interact with multiple systems.
In these cases, you can continue to leverage the datasets you have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results
alongside the prompts you maintain in Humanloop.

In this guide, we'll show an example of setting up a simple script to run such a self-hosted evaluation using our Python SDK.


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * You need to have a dataset in your project. See our dataset creation [/docs/datasets] guide if you don't yet have one.
 * You need to have a model config that you're trying to evaluate - create one in the Editor.


SETTING UP THE SCRIPT

### Install the latest version of the Humanloop Python SDK:

pip install humanloop



IN A NEW PYTHON SCRIPT, IMPORT THE HUMANLOOP SDK AND CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THE CLIENT:

from humanloop import Humanloop

humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key=YOUR_API_KEY, # Replace with your API key
)



RETRIEVE THE ID OF THE HUMANLOOP PROJECT YOU ARE WORKING IN - YOU CAN FIND THIS IN THE HUMANLOOP APP

PROJECT_ID = ... # Replace with the project ID



RETRIEVE THE DATASET YOU'RE GOING TO USE FOR EVALUATION FROM THE PROJECT

# Retrieve a dataset
DATASET_ID = ... # Replace with the dataset ID you are using for evaluation (this should be inside the project)
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(DATASET_ID).records



CREATE AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR

# Create an external evaluator
evaluator = humanloop.evaluators.create(
    name="My External Evaluator",
    description="An evaluator that runs outside of Humanloop runtime.",
    type="external",
    arguments_type="target_required",
    return_type="boolean",
)



RETRIEVE THE MODEL CONFIG YOU'RE EVALUATING

CONFIG_ID = ... # Replace with the model config ID you are evaluating (should be inside the project)
model_config = humanloop.model_configs.get(CONFIG_ID)



INITIATE AN EVALUATION RUN IN HUMANLOOP

evaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    config_id=CONFIG_ID,
    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
)


After this step, you'll see a new run in the Humanloop app, under the Evaluations tab of your project. It should have status
running.


ITERATE THROUGH THE DATAPOINTS IN YOUR DATASET AND USE THE MODEL CONFIG TO GENERATE LOGS FROM THEM

logs = []
for datapoint in datapoints:
    log = humanloop.chat_model_config(
        project_id=PROJECT_ID,
        model_config_id=model_config.id,
        inputs=datapoint.inputs,
        messages=[
            {key: value for key, value in dict(message).items() if value is not None}
            for message in datapoint.messages
        ],
        source_datapoint_id=datapoint.id,
    ).data[0]
    logs.append((log, datapoint))



EVALUATE THE LOGS USING YOUR OWN EVALUATION LOGIC AND POST THE RESULTS BACK TO HUMANLOOP. IN THIS EXAMPLE, WE USE AN EXTREMELY
SIMPLE EVALUATION FUNCTION FOR CLARITY.

for log, datapoint in logs:
    # The datapoint's 'target' field tells us the correct answer for this datapoint
    expected_answer = str(datapoint.target["answer"])

    # The log output is what the model produced
    model_output = log.output

    # The evaluation is a boolean, indicating whether the model was correct.
    result = expected_answer == model_output

    # Post the result back to Humanloop.
    evaluation_result_log = humanloop.evaluations.log_result(
        log_id=log.id,
        evaluator_id=evaluator.id,
        evaluation_run_external_id=evaluation_run.id,
        result=result,
    )



MARK THE EVALUATION RUN AS COMPLETED.

humanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status="completed")



REVIEW THE RESULTS

After running this script with the appropriate resource IDs (project, dataset, model config), you should see the results in the
Humanloop app, right alongside any other evaluations you have performed using the Humanloop runtime.

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE'LL DEMONSTRATE AN EVALUATION RUN WORKFLOW WHERE LOGS ARE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE HUMANLOOP
ENVIRONMENT AND POSTED VIA API.

If you are running your own infrastructure to generate logs, you can still leverage the Humanloop evaluations suite via our API.
The workflow looks like this:

 1. Trigger creation of an evaluation run
 2. Loop through the datapoints in your dataset and perform generations on your side
 3. Post the generated logs to the evaluation run

This works with any evaluator - if you have configured a Humanloop-runtime evaluator, these will be automatically run on each log
you post to the evaluation run; or, you can use self-hosted evaluators and post the results to the evaluation run yourself (see
Self-hosted evaluations [/docs/self-hosted-evaluations]).


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation guides.
 * You need to have a dataset in your project. See our dataset creation guide if you don't yet have one.
 * You need to have a model config that you're trying to evaluate - create one in the Editor.


SETTING UP THE SCRIPT


INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF THE HUMANLOOP PYTHON SDK

pip install humanloop



IN A NEW PYTHON SCRIPT, IMPORT THE HUMANLOOP SDK AND CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THE CLIENT

humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key=YOUR_API_KEY, # Replace with your Humanloop API key
)



RETRIEVE THE ID OF THE HUMANLOOP PROJECT YOU ARE WORKING IN

You can find this in the Humanloop app.

PROJECT_ID = ... # Replace with the project ID



RETRIEVE THE DATASET YOU'RE GOING TO USE FOR EVALUATION FROM THE PROJECT

# Retrieve a dataset
DATASET_ID = ... # Replace with the dataset ID you are using for evaluation. 
                                 # This must be a dataset in the project you are working in.
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(DATASET_ID).records



SET UP THE MODEL CONFIG YOU ARE EVALUATING

If you constructed this in Humanloop, retrieve by calling:

config = humanloop.model_configs.get(id=CONFIG_ID)


Alternatively, if your model config lives outside the Humanloop system, you can post it to Humanloop with the register model
config endpoint [/reference/model-configs/model-configs-register].

Either way, you need the ID of the config.

CONFIG_ID = <YOUR_CONFIG_ID>



IN THE HUMANLOOP APP, CREATE AN EVALUATOR

For this guide, we'll simply create a Valid JSON checker.

 1. Visit the Evaluations tab, and select Evaluators
 2. Click + New Evaluator and choose Code from the options.
 3. Select the Valid JSON preset on the left.
 4. Choose the mode Offline in the setting panel on the left.
 5. Click Create.
 6. Copy your new evaluator's ID from the address bar. It starts with evfn_.

EVALUATOR_ID = <YOUR_EVALUATOR_ID>



CREATE AN EVALUATION RUN WITH HL_GENERATED SET TO FALSE

This tells the Humanloop runtime that it should not trigger evaluations itself, but wait for them to be posted via the API.

evaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    config_id=CONFIG_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],
    hl_generated=False,
)


By default, the status of the evaluation after creation is pending. Before sending the generation logs, set the status to running.

humanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status="running")



ITERATE THROUGH THE DATAPOINTS IN THE DATASET, PRODUCE A GENERATION, AND POST IT THE EVALUATION

for datapoint in datapoints:
        # Use the datapoint to produce a log with the model config you are testing.
    # This will depend on whatever model calling setup you are using on your side.
    # For simplicity, we simply log a hardcoded
    log = {
        "project_id": PROJECT_ID,
        "config_id": CONFIG_ID,
        "messages":  [*config.chat_template, *datapoint.messages],
        "output": "Hello World!",
    }

    print(f"Logging generation for datapoint {datapoint.id}")
    humanloop.evaluations.log(
        evaluation_id=evaluation_run.id,
        log=log,
        datapoint_id=datapoint.id,
    )


RUN THE FULL SCRIPT ABOVE.

If everything goes well, you should now have posted a new evaluation run to Humanloop, and logged all the generations derived from
the underlying datapoints.

The Humanloop evaluation runtime will now iterate through those logs and run the Valid JSON evaluator on each of them. To check
progress:


VISIT YOUR PROJECT IN THE HUMANLOOP APP AND GO TO THE EVALUATIONS TAB.

You should see the run you recently created; click through to it and you'll see rows in the table showing the generations.

[file:df4a4526-f057-44ce-a1f7-b64dbcac3a5a]

In this case, all the evaluations returned False because the string "Hello World!" wasn't valid JSON. Try logging something which
is valid JSON to check that everything works as expected.


FULL SCRIPT

For reference, here's the full script you can use to get started quickly.

from humanloop import Humanloop

API_KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY>

humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key=API_KEY,
)

PROJECT_ID = <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
DATASET_ID = <YOUR_DATASET_ID>
CONFIG_ID = <YOUR_CONFIG_ID>
EVALUATOR_ID = <YOUR_EVALUATOR_ID>

# Retrieve the datapoints in the dataset.
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(dataset_id=DATASET_ID).records

# Retrieve the model config
config = humanloop.model_configs.get(id=CONFIG_ID)

# Create the evaluation run
evaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    config_id=CONFIG_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],
    hl_generated=False,
)
print(f"Started evaluation run {evaluation_run.id}")

# Set the status of the run to running.
humanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status="running")

# Iterate the datapoints and log a generation for each one.
for i, datapoint in enumerate(datapoints):
        # Produce the log somehow. This is up to you and your external setup!
      log = {
        "project_id": PROJECT_ID,
        "config_id": CONFIG_ID,
        "messages":  [*config.chat_template, *datapoint.messages],
        "output": "Hello World!", # Hardcoded example for demonstration..
    }

    print(f"Logging generation for datapoint {datapoint.id}")
    humanloop.evaluations.log(
        evaluation_id=evaluation_run.id,
        log=log,
        datapoint_id=datapoint.id,
    )

print(f"Completed evaluation run {evaluation_run.id}")


It's also a good practice to wrap the above code in a try-except block and to mark the evaluation run as failed (using
\`update_status\`) if an exception causes something to fail.",

SUBTITLE: >- THIS GUIDE DEMONSTRATES HOW TO RUN A BATCH GENERATION AND COLLECT MANUAL HUMAN FEEDBACK.


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations.
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.
 * Finally, you need at least a few logs in your project. Use the Editor to generate some logs if you don't have any yet.


SET UP AN EVALUATOR TO COLLECT HUMAN FEEDBACK

### From the Evaluations page, click **New Evaluator** and select **Human**. [file:4edafc15-f7e0-4b28-a9a4-0fa49812d2f4]


GIVE THE EVALUATOR A NAME AND DESCRIPTION AND CLICK CREATE IN THE TOP-RIGHT.


RETURN TO THE EVALUATIONS PAGE AND SELECT RUN EVALUATION.


CHOOSE THE MODEL CONFIG YOU ARE EVALUATING, A DATASET YOU WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE AGAINST AND THEN SELECT THE NEW HUMAN EVALUATOR.

[file:598d83e6-e674-4d9a-9628-3c102088bad0]


CLICK BATCH GENERATE AND FOLLOW THE LINK IN THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER TO SEE THE EVALUATION RUN.

[file:dbf386ef-89db-4530-8b83-b25593e9a840]


AS THE ROWS POPULATE WITH THE GENERATED OUTPUT FROM THE MODEL, YOU CAN REVIEW THOSE OUTPUTS AND APPLY FEEDBACK IN THE RATING
COLUMN. CLICK A ROW TO SEE THE FULL DETAILS OF THE LOG IN A DRAWER.


APPLY YOUR FEEDBACK EITHER DIRECTLY IN THE TABLE, OR FROM THE DRAWER.

[file:dafb8570-9392-4b31-9212-464809c619dc]


ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED PROVIDING FEEDBACK FOR ALL THE LOGS IN THE RUN, CLICK MARK AS COMPLETE IN THE TOP RIGHT OF THE PAGE.


YOU CAN REVIEW THE AGGREGATED FEEDBACK RESULTS IN THE STATS SECTION ON THIS PAGE.


CONFIGURING THE FEEDBACK SCHEMA

If you need a more complex feedback schema, visit the Settings page in your project and follow the link to Feedbacks. Here, you
can add more categories to the default feedback types. If you need more control over feedback types, you can create new ones via
the API [/reference/projects/createfeedbacktype].",

SUBTITLE: IMPROVE YOUR LLMS WITH EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES AND INTEGRATIONS.


WHAT ARE TOOLS?

Humanloop Tools can be broken down into two different categories:

 * Ways to integrate services or data sources into prompts. Integrating tools into your prompts allows you to fetch information to
   pass into your LLMs calls. We support both external API integrations as well as integrations within Humanloop.
 * A process to specify to an LLM the expected request/response model, think OpenAI Function calling
   [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling]. These use the universal JSON Schema syntax and follow OpenAI's
   function calling [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling] convention.

If you have a tool call in the prompt e.g. {{ google("population of india") }}, this will get executed and replaced with the
resulting text before the prompt is sent to the model. If your prompt contains an input variable {{ google(query) }} this will
take the input that is passed into the LLM call.

Tools for function calling can be defined inline in our Editor or centrally managed for an organization, and follow OpenAI's
function calling [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling] convention.

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE WE WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPENAI FUNCTION CALLING IN OUR EDITOR.

Humanloop's Editor supports the usage of OpenAI function calling
[https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/function-calling], which we refer to as JSON Schema tools. JSON Schema
tools follow the universal JSON Schema syntax [https://json-schema.org/] definition, similar to OpenAI function calling. You can
define inline JSON Schema tools as part of your model configuration in the editor. These tools allow you to define a structure for
OpenAI to follow when responding. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of using tools in the editor to interact with
gpt-4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CREATE A TOOL


PREREQUISITES

 * A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.
 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.

The current OpenAI list of supported models is:
 * gpt-4
 * gpt-4-1106-preview
 * gpt-4-0613
 * gpt-3.5-turbo
 * gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
 * gpt-3.5-turbo-0613

To create and use a tool follow the following steps:

### **Open the editor**: Start by opening the Humanloop Editor in your web browser. You can access this directly from your
Humanloop account dashboard.


SELECT THE MODEL: IN THE EDITOR, YOU'LL SEE AN OPTION TO SELECT THE MODEL. CHOOSE GPT-4 FROM THE DROPDOWN LIST.


DEFINE THE TOOL: TO DEFINE A TOOL, YOU'LL NEED TO USE THE UNIVERSAL JSON SCHEMA SYNTAX [https://json-schema.org/] SYNTAX. FOR THE
PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE, LET'S SELECT ONE OF OUR PRELOADED EXAMPLE TOOLS GET_CURRENT_WEATHER. IN PRACTICE THIS WOULD CORRESPOND TO A
FUNCTION YOU HAVE DEFINED LOCALLY, IN YOUR OWN CODE, AND YOU ARE DEFINING THE PARAMETERS AND STRUCTURE THAT YOU WANT OPENAI TO
RESPOND WITH TO INTEGRATE WITH THAT FUNCTION.

[file:44145798-5f2c-4d2a-8fc5-db016523afe3]


INPUT USER TEXT: LET'S INPUT SOME USER TEXT RELEVANT TO OUR TOOL TO TRIGGER OPENAI TO RESPOND WITH THE CORRESPONDING PARAMETERS.
SINCE WE'RE USING A WEATHER-RELATED TOOL, TYPE IN: WHAT'S THE WEATHER IN BOSTON?.

It should be noted that a user can ask a non-weather related question such as 'how are you today? ' and it likely wouldn't trigger
the model to respond in a format relative to the tool.




CHECK ASSISTANT RESPONSE: IF CORRECTLY SET UP, THE ASSISTANT SHOULD RESPOND WITH A PROMPT TO INVOKE THE TOOL, INCLUDING THE NAME
OF THE TOOL AND THE DATA IT REQUIRES. FOR OUR GET_CURRENT_WEATHER TOOL, IT MIGHT RESPOND WITH THE RELEVANT TOOL NAME AS WELL AS
THE FIELDS YOU REQUESTED, SUCH AS:

get_current_weather

{   
  "location": "Boston"  
}



INPUT TOOL PARAMETERS: THE RESPONSE CAN BE USED LOCALLY OR FOR PROTOTYPING YOU CAN PASS IN ANY RELEVANT VALUES. IN THE CASE OF OUR
GET_CURRENT_WEATHER TOOL, WE MIGHT RESPOND WITH PARAMETERS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE (E.G., 22) AND WEATHER CONDITION (E.G., SUNNY). TO
DO THIS, IN THE TOOL RESPONSE ADD THE PARAMETERS IN THE IN THE FORMAT { "TEMPERATURE": 22, "CONDITION": "SUNNY" }. TO NOTE, THE
RESPONSE FORMAT IS ALSO FLEXIBLE, INPUTTING 22, SUNNY LIKELY ALSO WORKS AND MIGHT HELP YOU ITERATE MORE QUICKLY IN YOUR
EXPERIMENTATION.


SUBMIT TOOL RESPONSE: AFTER DEFINING THE PARAMETERS, CLICK ON THE 'RUN' BUTTON TO SEND THE TOOL MESSAGE TO OPENAI.


REVIEW ASSISTANT RESPONSE: THE ASSISTANT SHOULD NOW RESPOND USING YOUR PARAMETERS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT MIGHT SAY: THE CURRENT WEATHER
IN BOSTON IS SUNNY WITH A TEMPERATURE OF 22 DEGREES.

SAVE THE MODEL CONFIG IF YOU ARE HAPPY WITH YOUR TOOL, YOU CAN SAVE THE MODEL CONFIG. THE TOOL WILL BE SAVED ON THAT MODEL CONFIG
AND CAN BE USED AGAIN IN THE FUTURE BY LOADING THE MODEL CONFIG AGAIN IN THE EDITOR OR BY CALLING THE MODEL CONFIG VIA OUR SDK.",

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE WE WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPENAI FUNCTION CALLING IN OUR PYTHON SDK

The Humanloop SDK provides an easy way for you to integrate the functionality of OpenAI function calling
[https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/function-calling], which we refer to as JSON Schema tools, into your
existing projects. Tools follow the same universal JSON Schema syntax [https://json-schema.org/] definition as OpenAI function
calling. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of using tools with the Humanloop SDK via the chat endpoint.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CREATING A TOOL


PREREQUISITES

 * A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.
 * Python installed - you can download and install Python by following the steps on the Python download page
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/].

This guide assumes you're using OpenAI with the \`gpt-4\` model. Only specific models from OpenAI are supported for function
calling.


INSTALL AND INITIALIZE THE SDK

The SDK requires Python 3.8 or greater. ### **Import the Humanloop SDK**: If you haven't done so already, you'll need to install
and import the Humanloop SDK into your Python environment. You can do this using pip:

pip install humanloop


Note, this guide was built with Humanloop==0.5.18.

Then import the SDK in your script:

from humanloop import Humanloop



INITIALIZE THE SDK: INITIALIZE THE HUMANLOOP SDK WITH YOUR API KEY:

from humanloop import Humanloop

hl = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>")



CREATE A CHAT WITH THE TOOL: WE'LL START WITH THE GENERAL CHAT ENDPOINT FORMAT.

from humanloop import Humanloop

hl = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>")


def run_conversation():
    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston?"}]
        
    # TODO - Add tools definition here
    
    response = hl.chat(
        project="Assistant",
        model_config={"model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": 100},
        messages=messages,
    )
    response = response.body["data"][0]



DEFINE THE TOOL: DEFINE A TOOL USING THE UNIVERSAL JSON SCHEMA SYNTAX [https://json-schema.org/] SYNTAX. LET'S ASSUME WE'VE
DEFINED A GET_CURRENT_WEATHER TOOL, WHICH RETURNS THE CURRENT WEATHER FOR A SPECIFIED LOCATION. WE'LL ADD IT IN VIA A "TOOLS":
TOOLS, FIELD. WE'VE ALSO DEFINED A DUMMY GET_CURRENT_WEATHER METHOD AT THE TOP. THIS CAN BE REPLACED BY YOUR OWN FUNCTION TO FETCH
REAL VALUES, FOR NOW WE'RE HARDCODING IT TO RETURN A RANDOM TEMPERATURE AND CLOUDY FOR THIS EXAMPLE.

from humanloop import Humanloop
import random
import json

hl = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>")

def get_current_weather(location, unit):
    # Your own function call logic
    # We will return dummy values in this example

    # Generate random temperature between 0 and 20
    temperature = random.randint(0, 20)

    return {"temperature": temperature, "other": "cloudy"}



def run_conversation():
    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather like in both Boston AND London tonight?",
        }
    ]
    tools = [
        {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    },
                    "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]},
                },
                "required": ["location"],
            },
        },
    ]

    response = hl.chat(
        project="Assistant",
        model_config={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "tools": tools, "max_tokens": 100},
        messages=messages,
    )
    response = response.body
    output_message = response["data"][0]["output_message"]

    # Remove the deprecated tool_call field (not nessecary for SDK rc verions >0.6)
    del output_message["tool_call"]

    # Add the output messge from the previous chat to the messages
    messages.append(output_message)
    
    # TODO - Add assistant response logic



CHECK ASSISTANT RESPONSE: THE CODE ABOVE WILL MAKE THE CALL TO OPENAI WITH THE TOOL BUT IT DOES NOTHING TO HANDLE THE ASSISTANT
RESPONSE. WHEN RESPONDING WITH A TOOL RESPONSE THE RESPONSE SHOULD HAVE A TOOL_CALLS FIELD. FETCH THAT VALUE AND PASS IT TO YOUR
OWN FUNCTION. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS CAN BE SEEN BELOW. REPLACE THE TODO - ADD ASSISTANT HANDLING LOGIC IN YOUR CODE FROM ABOVE WITH
THE FOLLOWING. MULTIPLE TOOL CALLS CAN BE RETURNED WITH THE LATEST OPENAI MODELS GPT-4-1106-PREVIEW AND GPT-3.5-TURBO-1106, SO
BELOW WE LOOP THROUGH THE TOOL_CALLS AND POPULATE THE RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY.

        # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool
      if output_message.get("tool_calls"):
        # Step 3: call the function
        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors
        available_functions = {
            "get_current_weather": get_current_weather,
        }

        for tool_call in output_message["tool_calls"]:
            function_name = tool_call["function"]["name"]
            function_args = json.loads(tool_call["function"]["arguments"])
            function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]
            function_response = function_to_call(
                location=function_args.get("location"),
                unit=function_args.get("unit"),
                
        # TODO - return the tool response back to OpenAI



RETURN THE TOOL RESPONSE: WE CAN THEN RETURN THE TOOL RESPONSE TO OPENAI. THIS CAN BE DONE BY FORMATTING OPENAI TOOL MESSAGE INTO
THE RELATIVE ASSISTANT MESSAGE SEEN BELOW ALONG WITH A TOOL MESSAGE WITH THE FUNCTION NAME AND FUNCTION RESPONSE.

        # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool
    if output_message.get("tool_calls"):
        # Step 3: call the function
        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors
        available_functions = {
            "get_current_weather": get_current_weather,
        }

        for tool_call in output_message["tool_calls"]:
            function_name = tool_call["function"]["name"]
            function_args = json.loads(tool_call["function"]["arguments"])
            function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]
            function_response = function_to_call(
                location=function_args.get("location"),
                unit=function_args.get("unit"),
            )

            # Step 4: send the response back to the model per function call
            messages.append(
                {
                    "role": "tool",
                    "content": json.dumps(function_response),
                    "tool_call_id": tool_call["id"],
                }
            )

        second_response = hl.chat(
            project="Assistant",
            model_config={
                "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
                "tools": tools,
                "max_tokens": 500,
            },
            messages=messages,
        )
        return second_response



REVIEW ASSISTANT RESPONSE: THE ASSISTANT SHOULD RESPOND WITH A MESSAGE THAT INCORPORATES THE PARAMETERS YOU PROVIDED, FOR EXAMPLE:
THE CURRENT WEATHER IN BOSTON IS 22 DEGREES AND CLOUDY. THE ABOVE CAN BE RUN BY ADDING THE PYTHON HANDLING LOGIC AT THE BOTH OF
YOUR FILE:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    response = run_conversation()
    response = response.body["data"][0]["output"]
    # Print to console the response from OpenAI with the formatted message
    print(response)

CREATE AND USE A SNIPPET TOOL


PREREQUISITES

 * A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.
 * Be on a paid plan - your organization has been upgraded from the Free tier.
 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.

The Snippet tool is not available for the Free tier. Please contact us if you wish to learn more about our [Enterprise
plan](https://humanloop.com/pricing)

To create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:

### Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.
[file:9f7f7fe7-f48c-46aa-95af-e7f3a563d394]


NAME THE TOOL ASSISTANT-PERSONALITIES AND GIVE IT A DESCRIPTION USEFUL ASSISTANT PERSONALITIES.


IN THE INITIAL BOX ADD HELPFUL-ASSISTANT AND GIVE IT A VALUE OF YOU ARE A HELPFUL ASSISTANT. YOU LIKE TO TELL JOKES AND IF ANYONE
ASKS YOUR NAME IS SAM.


LET'S ADD ANOTHER KEY-VALUE PAIR, SO PRESS THE ADD A KEY/VALUE PAIR BUTTON AND ADD A NEW KEY OF GRUMPY-ASSISTANT AND GIVE IT A
VALUE OF YOU ARE A GRUMPY ASSISTANT. YOU RARELY TRY TO HELP PEOPLE AND IF ANYONE ASKS YOUR NAME IS FREDDY..

[file:f044111a-6b9b-4235-a8d7-12cfcd39910e]


PRESS CREATE TOOL. NOW YOUR SNIPPETS ARE SET UP, YOU CAN USE IT TO POPULATE STRINGS IN YOUR PROMPT TEMPLATES ACROSS YOUR PROJECTS.


NAVIGATE TO THE EDITOR OF YOUR PREVIOUSLY CREATED PROJECT.


IN THE CHAT TEMPLATES SECTION, DELETE THE DEFAULT ASSISTANTS' STRING, AND ADD {{ ASSISTANT-PERSONALITIES(KEY) }}.

Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. \`{{ (key)
}}\`.


ENTER THE KEY HELPFUL-ASSISTANT. THE TOOL REQUIRES AN INPUT VALUE TO BE PROVIDED FOR THE KEY. WHEN ADDING THE TOOL AN INPUTS FIELD
WILL APPEAR IN THE TOP RIGHT OF THE EDITOR WHERE YOU CAN SPECIFY YOUR KEY.


PRESS THE RUN BUTTON IN THE EDITOR TO START THE CHAT WITH THE LLM. YOU CAN SEE THE RESPONSE OF THE LLM, AS WELL AS, SEE THE KEY
YOU PREVIOUSLY DEFINED ADD IN THE CHAT ON THE RIGHT.

[file:20427cb0-13ba-407b-a2ff-124d5bdc128c]


CHANGE THE KEY TO GRUMPY-ASSISTANT.

If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see
it in the preview.


ASK THE LLM, I'M A CUSTOMER AND NEED HELP SOLVING THIS ISSUE. CAN YOU HELP?'. YOU SHOULD SEE A GRUMPY RESPONSE FROM "FREDDY" NOW.


IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC KEY YOU WOULD LIKE TO HARDCODE IN THE PROMPT, YOU CAN DEFINE IT USING THE LITERAL KEY VALUE: {{
<YOUR-TOOL-NAME>("KEY") }}, SO IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE {{ ASSISTANT-PERSONALITIES("GRUMPY-ASSISTANT") }}. DELETE THE
GRUMPY-ASSISTANT FIELD AND ADD IT INTO YOUR CHAT TEMPLATE.


IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOU'RE GRUMPY ASSISTANT, SAVE YOUR MODEL CONFIG.

CREATING AND LINKING A JSON SCHEMA TOOL


PREREQUISITES

 * A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.
 * Be on a paid plan - your organization has been upgraded from the Free tier.
 * You already have a project created - if not, please pause and first follow our project creation
   [/docs/create-a-project-from-the-playground] guides.

The Snippet tool is not available for the Free tier. Please contact us if you wish to learn more about our [Enterprise
plan](https://humanloop.com/pricing)

To create a JSON Schema tool that can be reusable across your organization, follow the following steps:

### Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the **Json Schema** tool
card. [file:14681924-5ff4-4f14-b015-ca0fc40c7489]


WITH THE DIALOG OPEN, DEFINE YOUR TOOL WITH NAME, DESCRIPTION, AND PARAMETERS VALUES. OUR GUIDE FOR USING OPENAI FUNCTION CALLING
IN THE PLAYGROUND [/docs/create-a-tool-in-the-editor] CAN BE A USEFUL REFERENCE IN THIS CASE. WE CAN USE THE GET_CURRENT_WEATHER
SCHEMA IN THIS CASE. PASTE THE FOLLOWING INTO THE DIALOG:

{
  "name": "get_current_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Location",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Unit",
        "enum": [
          "celsius",
          "fahrenheit"
        ]
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "location"
    ]
  }
}



PRESS THE CREATE BUTTON.


NAVIGATE TO THE EDITOR OF YOUR PREVIOUSLY CREATED PROJECT. AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A SUPPORTED MODEL, SUCH AS GPT-3.5-TURBO.

The current OpenAI list of supported models is:

 * gpt-4
 * gpt-4-1106-preview
 * gpt-4-0613
 * gpt-3.5-turbo
 * gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
 * gpt-3.5-turbo-0613


IN THE TOOLS SECTION OF THE EDITOR PRESS THE ADD TOOL BUTTON.


IN THE DROPDOWN, GO TO THE LINK EXISTING TOOL OPTION. YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR GET_CURRENT_WEATHER TOOL, CLICK ON IT TO LINK IT TO YOUR
EDITOR.

[file:2cc3b1b7-56a4-4a54-9aa9-8264c94e7cfe]


NOW THAT YOUR TOOL IS LINKED YOU CAN START USING IT AS YOU WOULD NORMALLY USE AN INLINE TOOL. IN THE CHAT SECTION, IN THE USER
INPUT, ENTER "WHAT IS THE WEATHER IN LONDON?"


PRESS THE RUN BUTTON.


YOU SHOULD SEE THE ASSISTANT RESPOND WITH THE TOOL RESPONSE AND A NEW TOOL FIELD INSERTED TO ALLOW YOU TO INSERT AN ANSWER. IN
THIS CASE, PUT IN 22 INTO THE TOOL RESPONSE AND PRESS RUN.

[file:eb4aa735-5991-47a0-91c3-7d5cf6d4f9d4]


THE MODEL WILL RESPOND WITH THE CURRENT WEATHER IN LONDON IS 22 DEGREES.


YOU'VE LINKED A TOOL TO YOUR MODEL CONFIG, NOW LET'S SAVE IT. PRESS THE SAVE BUTTON AND NAME YOUR MODEL CONFIG
WEATHER-MODEL-CONFIG.


NOW THAT'S WE'VE LINKED YOUR GET_CURRENT_WEATHER TOOL TO YOUR MODEL CONFIG, LET'S TRY UPDATING THE BASE TOOL AND SEE HOW IT
PROPAGATES THE CHANGES DOWN INTO YOUR SAVED WEATHER-MODEL-CONFIG CONFIG. NAVIGATE BACK TO THE ORGANIZATION TOOLS SECTION BY
CLICKING THE TOOLS BUTTON IN THE TOP RIGHT OF THE NAV BAR.


CLICK THE MENU DROPDOWN BUTTON OF THE GET_CURRENT_WEATHER TOOL AND PRESS EDIT.


LET'S UPDATE BOTH THE NAME, AS WELL AS THE REQUIRED FIELDS. FOR THE NAME, UPDATE IT TO GET_CURRENT_WEATHER_UPDATED AND FOR THE
REQUIRED FIELDS, ADD UNIT AS A REQUIRED FIELD. THE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS NOW:

{
  "name": "get_current_weather_updated",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Location",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Unit",
        "enum": [
          "celsius",
          "fahrenheit"
        ]
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "location",
      "unit"
    ]
  }
}



PRESS THE SAVE BUTTON, THEN THE FOLLOWING CONTINUE BUTTON TO CONFIRM.


YOUR TOOL IS NOW UPDATED. NAVIGATE BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS PROJECT, AND OPEN THE EDITOR. YOU SHOULD SEE THE WEATHER-MODEL-CONFIG
LOADED AS THE ACTIVE CONFIG. YOU SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO SEE THE NAME OF YOUR PREVIOUSLY LINKED TOOL IN THE TOOLS SECTION NOW SAYS
GET_CURRENT_WEATHER_UPDATED.


IN THE CHAT SECTION ENTER IN AGAIN, WHAT IS THE WEATHER IN LONDON?, AND PRESS RUN AGAIN.


YOU SHOULD SEE THE UPDATED TOOL RESPONSE, AND HOW IT NOW CONTAINS THE UNIT FIELD.

Each active tool in your organisation will have a unique signature that you can use to specify the tool within a prompt template.

You can find the signature in the pink box on each tool card on the **Tools** page.

You can also use double curly brackets - \`{{\` - within the prompt template editor in playground to see a dropdown of available tools.

In the case of **Pinecone** tools, the signature takes two positional arguments: \`query\`(the query text passed to Pinecone) and \`top_k\`(the number of similar chunks to retrieve from Pinecone for the query).

OpenAI's embedding models [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PREREQUISITES

 * A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page [https://app.humanloop.com/signup].
 * A Pinecone account - you can create one by going to their sign up page [https://app.pinecone.io/?sessionType=signup].
 * Python installed - you can download and install Python by following the steps on the Python download page
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/].

If you have an existing Pinecone index that was created using one of [OpenAI's embedding
models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings), you can skip to section: **Setup Humanloop**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SET UP PINECONE


INSTALL THE PINECONE SDK

If you already have the Pinecone SDK installed, skip to the next section.

### Install the Pinecone Python SDK in your terminal: \`\`\`shell pip install pinecone-client \`\`\` ### Start a Python interpreter:
\`\`\`shell python \`\`\` ### Go to the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/) API Keys tab and create an API key - copy the key
\`value\` and the \`environment\`. ### Test your Pinecone API key and environment by initialising the SDK \`\`\`python >>> import
pinecone >>> pinecone.init(api_key="", environment="") \`\`\` ***


CREATE A PINECONE INDEX

Now we'll initialise a Pinecone index, which is where we'll store our vector embeddings. We will be using OpenAI's ada model
[https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings] to create vectors to save to Pinecone, which has an
output dimension of 1536 that we need to specify upfront when creating the index:

import pinecone

# Initialise the SDK
pinecone.init(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>", environment="<YOUR ENV>")

# Create index
# We can reference the dimension of the embeddings on OpenAI
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings
pinecone.create_index('humanloop-demo', dimension=1536)

# Connect to the index
index = pinecone.Index('humanloop-demo')


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PREPROCESS THE DATA

Now that you have a Pinecone index, we need some data to put in it. In this section we'll pre-process some data ready for
embedding and storing to the index in the next section.

We'll use the awesome Hugging Face datasets [https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub] to source a demo dataset (following
the Pinecone quick-start guide [https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/semantic-text-search]). In practice you will customise this step to
your own use case.

### First install Hugging Face datasets using pip:

pip install datasets



NEXT DOWNLOAD THE QUORA DATASET:

from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('quora', split='train')



NOW WE CAN PREVIEW THE DATASET - IT CONTAINS ~400K PAIRS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE QUESTIONS FROM QUORA:

print(dataset[:5])


{'questions': [{'id': [1, 2],
   'text': ['What is the step by step guide to invest in share market in india?',
    'What is the step by step guide to invest in share market?']},
  {'id': [3, 4],
   'text': ['What is the story of Kohinoor (Koh-i-Noor) Diamond?',
    'What would happen if the Indian government stole the Kohinoor (Koh-i-Noor) diamond back?']},
  {'id': [5, 6],
   'text': ['How can I increase the speed of my internet connection while using a VPN?',
    'How can Internet speed be increased by hacking through DNS?']},
  {'id': [7, 8],
   'text': ['Why am I mentally very lonely? How can I solve it?',
    'Find the remainder when [math]23^{24}[/math] is divided by 24,23?']},
  {'id': [9, 10],
   'text': ['Which one dissolve in water quikly sugar, salt, methane and carbon di oxide?',
    'Which fish would survive in salt water?']}],
 'is_duplicate': [False, False, False, False, False]}



EXTRACT THE TEXT FROM THE QUESTIONS INTO A SINGLE LIST READY FOR EMBEDDING:

questions = []

for record in dataset['questions']:
    questions.extend(record['text'])

# remove duplicates
questions = list(set(questions))
print('\\n'.join(questions[:5]))
print(f"Number of questions: {len(questions)}")

***


POPULATE PINECONE

Now that you have a Pinecone index and a dataset of text chunks, we can populate the index with embeddings before moving on to
Humanloop. We'll use one of OpenAI's embedding models to create the vectors for storage.


INSTALL AND INITIALISE OPEN AI SDK

If you already have your OpenAI key and the SDK installed, skip to the next section.

### Install the OpenAI SDK using pip:

$ pip install openai



INITIALISE THE SDK (YOU'LL NEED AN OPENAI KEY FROM YOUR OPENAI ACCOUNT [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys])

import openai

openai.api_key = "<YOUR OPENAI API KEY>"



POPULATE THE INDEX

If you already have a Pinecone index set up, skip to the next section.

### Embed the questions and store them in Pinecone with the corresponding text as metadata:

# For the sake of the demo we just use a small subset of the data
embed_questions = questions[:100]

for i, question in enumerate(embed_questions):
    # Embed the question
    embedding = client.embeddings.create(input=question, model="text-embedding-ada-002").data[0].embedding

    # Upsert to Pinecone - expects tuples of (id, vector, metadata to associate to vector)
    index.upsert([(str(i), embedding, {"text": question})])

# check number of records in the index
index.describe_index_stats()



YOU CAN NOW TRY OUT THE SEMANTIC SEARCH WITH A TEST QUESTION:

test_query = "What is the first law of Thermodynamics?"

# create the query vector
test_query = openai.Embedding.create(
      input=test_query, model="text-embedding-ada-002"
    ).data[0].embedding

# run the query
result = index.query(test_query, top_k=3, include_metadata=True)
print(result)


You should see semantically similar questions retrieved with the corresponding similarity scores:

{'matches': [{'id': '72',
              'metadata': {'text': 'Is kinetic energy gained when it is moving '
                                   'at a constant speed or when it is '
                                   'accelerating?'},
              'score': 0.792976439,
              'values': []},
             {'id': '28',
              'metadata': {'text': 'Is energy in vacuum real? How do we know '
                                   'that this energy that can be borrowed and '
                                   'returned immediately is real if virtual '
                                   "particles didn't exist then?"},
              'score': 0.787870169,
              'values': []},
             {'id': '425',
              'metadata': {'text': 'What is the most intriguing scientific '
                                   'paradox?'},
              'score': 0.78692925,
              'values': []}],
 'namespace': ''}

SET UP HUMANLOOP


CONFIGURE PINECONE

You're now ready to configure a Pinecone tool in Humanloop:

### Log on to Humanloop and navigate to the **Tools** tab available beside **Playground** at the top right. ### Under **Add a new
tool**, select the **Pinecone Search** card. ### You need to configure both the Pinecone and OpenAI related values. These should
be the same values you used when setting up your Pinecone index in the previous sections. All these values are editable later. 1.
**For Pinecone:** populate values for \`Name\` (use _quora_search_), \`pinecone_key\`, \`pinecone_environment\`, \`pinecone_index\` (note:
we named our index \`humanloop-demo\`). The name will be used to create the signature for the tool that you will use in your prompt
templates in the next section. 2. **For OpenAI: **populate the \`openai_key\` and \`openai_model\` (note: we used the
\`text-embedding-ada-002\` model above) ### Save the tool by selecting **Create Tool.**

An active tool for quora_search will now appear on the tools tab and you're ready to use it within a prompt template.

[file:ec96aa54-88f9-4b62-9b7d-b5c23b8a1990]


ENHANCE YOUR PROMPT TEMPLATE

Now that we have a Pinecone tool configured we can use this to pull relevant context into your prompts.

This is an effective way to enrich your LLM applications with knowledge from your own internal documents and also help fix
hallucinations.

### Select **Playground** in the top right of the screen and toggle to **Completion** mode. ### Copy and paste the following text
into the **Prompt template** box:

Prompts define how an large language model (LLM) behaves.

Large language models take in natural language, code, images and other data types as inputs and output text. Defining the inputs to the model is essentially how you “program” the model to do a task.

A Prompt on Humanloop encapsulates the instructions and other configurations for how it should do a specific task. Prompts consist of a template such as \`Write a song about {{topic}}\` as well as the model and the parameters that define how it behaves.

Inputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. \`{{topic}}\` and the value to variable will need to be supplied at query time.

This separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different instructions, models and evaluate any changes. The configuration is stored in the Prompt and the query time data are stored in Logs, which can then be re-used in Datasets.

A Prompt can be serialized as a Promptfile.

You should create a new Prompt for every different ‘task to be done’ with the LLM. For example each of these tasks are things that can be done by an LLM and should be a separate Prompt File: extractive summary, title creator, outline generator etc.

A Prompt file can have multiple versions as you try out different models, params or templates, but they should all be doing the same task, and in general should be swappable with one-another.

By versioning your Prompts, you can track how adjustments to the template or parameters influence the LLM's responses. This is crucial for iterative development, as you can pinpoint which versions produce the most relevant or accurate outputs for your specific use case.

Prompts are callable as an API. You supply and query-time data such as input values or user messages, and the model will respond with its text output

[file:ef1a06c6-c964-4f68-99ab-db2a3918bbf7]

Tools are functions that can extend your LLMs with access to external data sources and enabling them to take actions.

Humanloop Tools can be used in multiple ways:

 * within the Prompt template
 * provided to the LLM as something it can call (think OpenAI Function calling
   [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling])
 * as part of a chain of LLM calls and other events, such as a Retrieval Tool in a RAG pipeline

Some Tools are executable within Humanloop, and these offer the greatest utility and convenience. For example Google and Pinecone
have pre-built integrations and so so Tools that use them can be automatically performed and inserted into the right place.


TOOLS IN A PROMPT TEMPLATE

You can add a tool call in a prompt template and the result will be inserted into the prompt sent to the model. This allows you to
insert retreived information into your LLMs calls.

For example, if you have {{ google("population of india") }} in your template, this Google tool will get executed and replaced
with the resulting text “1.42 billion (2024)” before the prompt is sent to the model. Additionally, if your template contains a
Tool call that uses an input variable e.g. {{ google(query) }} this will take the value of the input supplied in the request,
compute the output of the Google tool, and insert that result into the resulting prompt that is stnd to the model.

Example of a Tool being used within a Prompt template. This example will mean that this Prompt needs two inputs to be supplied
(query, and top_k)


TOOLS AS FUNCTION CALLING

Certain large language models support function calling. For these models you can supply the description of functions and model can
choose to call one or many of them by providing the values to call it with.

Editor.

TOOLS WITHIN A CHAIN

You can call a Tool within a chain of events and post the result to Humanloop.

In this way you benefit from being able to see the logs, and version your tool, enabling you to make any changes and

SUBTITLE: >- EVALUATORS ON HUMANLOOP ARE FUNCTIONS THAT CAN BE USED TO JUDGE THE OUTPUT OF PROMPTS, TOOLS OR OTHER EVALUATORS.

[file:dac5d1e8-522d-4b1f-86c3-9225df37dd2f]

Evaluators on Humanloop are functions that can be used to judge the output of Prompts, Tools or other Evaluators

Evaluators are functions which takes an LLM-generated Log as an argument and returns an evaluation. The evaluation is typically
either a boolean or a number, indicating how well the model performed according to criteria you determine based on your use case.

Evaluators can be used for monitoring live data as well as running evaluations.


TYPES OF EVALUATORS

There are three types of Evaluators: AI, code, and human.

 * Python - using our in-browser editor, define simple Python functions to act as evaluators
 * AI - use a large language model to evaluate another LLM! Our evaluator editor allows you to define a special-purpose prompt
   which passes data from the underlying log to a language model. This type of evaluation is particularly useful for more
   subjective evaluation such as verifying appropriate tone-of-voice or factuality given an input set of facts.
 * Human - collate human feedback against the logs


MODES: MONITORING VS. TESTING

Evaluation is useful for both testing new model configs as you develop them and for monitoring live deployments that are already
in production.

To handle these different use cases, there are two distinct modes of evaluator - online and offline.


ONLINE

Online evaluators are for use on logs generated in your project, including live in production. Typically, they are used to monitor
deployed model performance over time.

Online evaluators can be set to run automatically whenever logs are added to a project. The evaluator takes the log as an
argument.


OFFLINE

Offline evaluators are for use with predefined test datasets [./datasets] in order to evaluate models as you iterate in your
prompt engineering workflow, or to test for regressions in a CI environment.

A test dataset is a collection of datapoints, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming.
Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.

When you run an offline evaluation, Humanloop iterates through each datapoint in the dataset and triggers a fresh LLM generation
using the inputs of the testcase and the model config being evaluated. For each test case, your evaluator function will be called,
taking as arguments the freshly generated log and the testcase datapoint that gave rise to it. Typically, you would write your
evaluator to perform some domain-specific logic to determine whether the model-generated log meets your desired criteria (as
specified in the datapoint 'target').


HUMANLOOP-HOSTED VS. SELF-HOSTED

Conceptually, evaluation runs have two components:

 1. Generation of logs from the datapoints
 2. Evaluating those logs.

Using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted.
Similarly, evaluations of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app) or
self-hosted (see our guide on self-hosted evaluations [/docs/self-hosted-evaluations]).

In fact, it's possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime generations and evaluations in any combination you wish.
When creating an evaluation via the API, set the hl_generated flag to False to indicate that you are posting the logs from your
own infrastructure (see our guide on evaluating externally-generated logs [/docs/evaluating-externally-generated-logs]). Include
an evaluator of type External to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure. You can include
multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include any combination of External (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime
evaluators.",

MODELS

The Humanloop platform gives you the ability to use and improve large language models like GPT‑3. There are many different models
from multiple providers. The models may be different sizes, may have been trained differently, and are likely to perform
differently. Humanloop gives you the ability to find the best model for your situation and optimise performance and cost.

some task-specific data.

Finetuning lets you get more out of the models by providing:

 1. Higher quality results than prompt design
 2. Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt
 3. Token savings due to shorter prompts
 4. Lower latency requests


MODEL CONFIG

This is the prompt template, the model (e.g. text-davinci-002) and the various parameters such as temperature that define how the
model will generate text.

A new model config is generated for each unique set of parameters used within that project. This is so you can compare different
model configs to see which perform better, for things like the prompt, or settings like temperature, or stop sequences.


PROMPT TEMPLATES

This is the prompt that is fed to the model, which also allows the use of variables. This allows you track how the same prompt is
being used with different input values.

The variables are surrounded by {{ and }} like this:

The input name is ‘topic’ and the value will be inserted into the prompt at runtime. [file:3675d889-25c2-4bc5-9cf2-56228d0e3ff8]


DATAPOINT

This is a generation from the model. It contains the inputs and the output and tracks which model config was used.

In the above example, the prompt template has one input called ‘topic’ and the output will be the completion. Each time this model
is called it will create a datapoint with the actual values.

An example datapoint for the limerick example prompt template above. [file:92e9b487-03d3-4486-84ee-bf5e6423cc9d]


FEEDBACK

Human feedback is crucial to help understand how your models are performing and to direct you in the ways to improve them.

Explicit feedback these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.

Implicit feedback – actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user
‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).

You can also have corrections as a feedback too.


EXPERIMENT

Experiments help remove the guesswork from working with large language models. Experiments allow you to set up A/B test between
multiple different model configs. This enables you to try out alternative prompts or models and use the feedback from your users
to determine which works better.


SEMANTIC SEARCH

SUBTITLE: OUR FILE FORMAT FOR SERIALISING PROMPTS TO STORE ALONGSIDE YOUR SOURCE CODE.

Our .prompt file format is a serialized version of a model config that is designed to be human-readable and suitable for checking
into your version control systems alongside your code.


FORMAT

The .prompt file is heavily inspired by MDX [https://mdxjs.com/], with model and hyperparameters specified in a YAML header
alongside a JSX-inspired format for your Chat Template.


BASIC EXAMPLES

\`\`\`jsx Chat --- model: gpt-4 temperature: 1.0 max_tokens: -1 provider: openai endpoint: chat --- You are a friendly assistant. \`\`\`
\`\`\`jsx Completion --- model: claude-2 temperature: 0.7 max_tokens: 256 top_p: 1.0 provider: anthropic endpoint: complete ---

### Multi-modality and Images

Images can be specified using nested \`<image>\` tags within a \`<user>\` message. To specify text alongside the image, use a \`<text>\` tag.

TOOLS, TOOL CALLS AND TOOL RESPONSES

Specify the tools available to the model as a JSON list in the YAML header.

Tool calls in assistant messages can be added with nested <tool> tags. A <tool> tag within an <assistant> tag denotes a tool call
of type: "function", and requires the attributes name and id. The text wrapped in a <tool> tag should be a JSON-formatted string
containing the tool call's arguments.

Tool call responses can then be added with <tool> tags after the <assistant> message.

Sorting and filtering are supported through query params.

Sorting is supported for the source, model, timestamp, and feedback-{output_name} columns. Specify sorting with the sort query
param, with values {column}.{ordering}. E.g. ?sort=source.asc&sort=model.desc will yield a multi-column sort. First by source then
by model.

Filtering is supported for the source, model, feedback-{output_name}, evaluator-{evaluator_external_id} columns.

Specify filtering with the source_filter, model_filter, feedback-{output.name}_filter and evaluator-{evaluator_external_id}_filter
query params.

E.g. ?source_filter=AI&source_filter=user_1234&feedback-explicit_filter=good will only show rows where the source is "AI" or
"user_1234", and where the latest feedback for the "explicit" output group is "good".

An additional date range filter is supported for the Timestamp column (i.e. Log.created_at). These are supported through the
start_date and end_date query parameters.

Searching is supported for the model inputs and output. Specify a search term with the search query param. E.g.
?search=hello%20there will cause a case-insensitive search across model inputs and output.",

Developing, managing and evaluating prompts for LLMs is surprisingly hard and dissimilar to traditional software in the following ways:

- **Subject matter experts matter more than ever.** As LLMs are being applied to all different domains, the people that know how they should best perform are rarely the software engineers but the experts in that field.
- **AI output is often non-deterministic.** Innocuous changes to the prompts can causes unforeseen issues elsewhere.
- **AI outputs are subjective**. It’s hard to measure how well products are working and so, without robust evaluation, larger companies simply can’t trust putting generative AI in production.

Many companies struggle to enable the collaboration needed between product leaders, subject matter experts and developers. Often they'll rely on a hodge-podge of tools like the OpenAI Playground, custom scripts and complex spreadsheets. The process is slow and error-prone, wasting engineering time and leading to long delays and feelings of uncertainty.

SUBTITLE: >- IN THIS GUIDE, WE'LL DEMONSTRATE AN EVALUATION RUN WORKFLOW WHERE LOGS ARE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE HUMANLOOP
ENVIRONMENT AND POSTED VIA API.

If you are running your own infrastructure to generate logs, you can still leverage the Humanloop evaluations suite via our API.
The workflow looks like this:

 1. Trigger creation of an evaluation run
 2. Loop through the datapoints in your dataset and perform generations on your side
 3. Post the generated logs to the evaluation run

This works with any evaluator - if you have configured a Humanloop-runtime evaluator, these will be automatically run on each log
you post to the evaluation run; or, you can use self-hosted evaluators and post the results to the evaluation run yourself (see
Self-hosted evaluations [/docs/self-hosted-evaluations]).


PREREQUISITES

 * You need to have access to evaluations
 * You also need to have a project created - if not, please first follow our project creation guides.
 * You need to have a dataset in your project. See our dataset creation guide if you don't yet have one.
 * You need to have a model config that you're trying to evaluate - create one in the Editor.


SETTING UP THE SCRIPT


INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF THE HUMANLOOP PYTHON SDK

pip install humanloop



IN A NEW PYTHON SCRIPT, IMPORT THE HUMANLOOP SDK AND CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THE CLIENT

humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key=YOUR_API_KEY, # Replace with your Humanloop API key
)



RETRIEVE THE ID OF THE HUMANLOOP PROJECT YOU ARE WORKING IN

You can find this in the Humanloop app.

PROJECT_ID = ... # Replace with the project ID



RETRIEVE THE DATASET YOU'RE GOING TO USE FOR EVALUATION FROM THE PROJECT

# Retrieve a dataset
DATASET_ID = ... # Replace with the dataset ID you are using for evaluation. 
                                 # This must be a dataset in the project you are working in.
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(DATASET_ID).records



SET UP THE MODEL CONFIG YOU ARE EVALUATING

If you constructed this in Humanloop, retrieve by calling:

config = humanloop.model_configs.get(id=CONFIG_ID)


Alternatively, if your model config lives outside the Humanloop system, you can post it to Humanloop with the register model
config endpoint [/reference/model-configs/model-configs-register].

Either way, you need the ID of the config.

CONFIG_ID = <YOUR_CONFIG_ID>



IN THE HUMANLOOP APP, CREATE AN EVALUATOR

For this guide, we'll simply create a Valid JSON checker.

 1. Visit the Evaluations tab, and select Evaluators
 2. Click + New Evaluator and choose Code from the options.
 3. Select the Valid JSON preset on the left.
 4. Choose the mode Offline in the setting panel on the left.
 5. Click Create.
 6. Copy your new evaluator's ID from the address bar. It starts with evfn_.

EVALUATOR_ID = <YOUR_EVALUATOR_ID>



CREATE AN EVALUATION RUN WITH HL_GENERATED SET TO FALSE

This tells the Humanloop runtime that it should not trigger evaluations itself, but wait for them to be posted via the API.

evaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    config_id=CONFIG_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],
    hl_generated=False,
)


By default, the status of the evaluation after creation is pending. Before sending the generation logs, set the status to running.

humanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status="running")



ITERATE THROUGH THE DATAPOINTS IN THE DATASET, PRODUCE A GENERATION, AND POST IT THE EVALUATION

for datapoint in datapoints:
        # Use the datapoint to produce a log with the model config you are testing.
    # This will depend on whatever model calling setup you are using on your side.
    # For simplicity, we simply log a hardcoded
    log = {
        "project_id": PROJECT_ID,
        "config_id": CONFIG_ID,
        "messages":  [*config.chat_template, *datapoint.messages],
        "output": "Hello World!",
    }

    print(f"Logging generation for datapoint {datapoint.id}")
    humanloop.evaluations.log(
        evaluation_id=evaluation_run.id,
        log=log,
        datapoint_id=datapoint.id,
    )


RUN THE FULL SCRIPT ABOVE.

If everything goes well, you should now have posted a new evaluation run to Humanloop, and logged all the generations derived from
the underlying datapoints.

The Humanloop evaluation runtime will now iterate through those logs and run the Valid JSON evaluator on each of them. To check
progress:


VISIT YOUR PROJECT IN THE HUMANLOOP APP AND GO TO THE EVALUATIONS TAB.

You should see the run you recently created; click through to it and you'll see rows in the table showing the generations.

[file:df4a4526-f057-44ce-a1f7-b64dbcac3a5a]

In this case, all the evaluations returned False because the string "Hello World!" wasn't valid JSON. Try logging something which
is valid JSON to check that everything works as expected.


FULL SCRIPT

For reference, here's the full script you can use to get started quickly.

CONFIG_ID = <YOUR_CONFIG_ID>
EVALUATOR_ID = <YOUR_EVALUATOR_ID>

# Retrieve the datapoints in the dataset.
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(dataset_id=DATASET_ID).records

# Retrieve the model config
config = humanloop.model_configs.get(id=CONFIG_ID)

# Create the evaluation run
evaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    config_id=CONFIG_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],
    hl_generated=False,
)
print(f"Started evaluation run {evaluation_run.id}")

# Set the status of the run to running.
humanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status="running")

# Iterate the datapoints and log a generation for each one.
for i, datapoint in enumerate(datapoints):
        # Produce the log somehow. This is up to you and your external setup!
      log = {
        "project_id": PROJECT_ID,
        "config_id": CONFIG_ID,
        "messages":  [*config.chat_template, *datapoint.messages],

The following table summarizes the HTTP response codes you may receive from the Primer REST API.

Status Code Description 200 Success 400 Bad Request 401 Unauthorized 403 Forbidden 404 Entity Not Found 409 Entity Already Exists
422 Input Validation Failed


ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

{
  "error": {
    "errorId": "AnErrorId",
    "description": "A human description of the error.",
    "diagnosticsId": "1234567890",
    "validationErrors": []
  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into
your account. DECLINED This payment was declined by the processor, either at a gateway or acquirer level. See the reason object in
your response payload for more details. CANCELLED The payment was cancelled prior to it being settled.

MIGRATING TO V2.1

The latest version of our APIs focus on capturing more details to enable a richer checkout experience. Some of these details are
required to allow configuration of the checkout via the Primer Dashboard. Also some of these details are needed to work with
advanced Payment Processors or Payment Methods.

The examples below only illustrate how to transition between the two versions of the endpoints, however you should read the latest
API Reference linked above for details on the usage of the endpoints. Also read how to introduce API Versioning into your requests
in the latest API Reference linked above.


CLIENT SESSION

This is an example of a request in v1: POST /auth/client-token.

  "customerCountryCode": "GB",
  "customerId": "customer-123",
  "checkout": {
    "paymentFlow": "DEFAULT"

SUMMARY OF THE V2.1 CHANGES

 * order is now called orderDetails
 * lineItems is now a top-level element
 * amount has been removed. You should always specify lineItems and we would dynamically calculate the amount. See our API
   Reference [https://apiref.primer.io/reference] for how we calculate the amount.

ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

    "errorId": "AnErrorId",
    "description": "A human description of the error.",
    "diagnosticsId": "1234567890",

  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into
your account. DECLINED This payment was declined by the processor, either at a gateway or acquirer level. See the reason object in
your response payload for more details. CANCELLED The payment was cancelled prior to it being settled.

MANAGING API KEYS

Head up to the Developers area [https://sandbox-dashboard.primer.io/developers] on the dashboard to manage your API keys.

You will be able to generate or revoke API keys and edit their respective scopes. Be aware that any changes to existing API keys
will be reflected immediately and could cause unwanted side effects.

ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

{
  "error": {
    "errorId": "AnErrorId",
    "description": "A human description of the error.",
    "diagnosticsId": "1234567890",
    "validationErrors": []
  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into
your account. DECLINED This payment was declined by the processor, either at a gateway or acquirer level. See the reason object in
your response payload for more details. CANCELLED The payment was cancelled prior to it being settled.

If this is the case, make another request with the same idempotency key:

JINJA TEMPLATING

Jinja is a powerful templating syntax useful for dynamic content. Most commonly, you’ll use it to reference Prompt Variables.
Below are the most common things you’re likely to want to do, but you can find jinja’s complete documentation here
[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/].


VARIABLES

Reference variables using double-curly-brackets. For example,

\`\`\` You are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant. \`\`\` Note that all variables are treated as strings!


CONDITIONALS

Perform conditional logic based on your input variables using if/else statements

\`\`\` You are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant. {% if personality_type == "rude" %} You end every message with a frowning
emoji. {% else %} You end every message with a smiling emoji. {% endif %} \`\`\`

WHAT IS A DOCUMENT INDEX?

Document indexes act as a collection of documents grouped together for performing searches against for a specific use case. For
example, if you are creating a chatbot to query against OpenAI’s help center documents, the text files of each article in the help
center would be stored in one index. Here's how it looks in Vellum's UI:

Document Index

HOW TO UPLOAD DOCUMENTS?

You can manually upload files through the UI or via API [https://docs.vellum.ai/api-reference/documents/upload].

Upload Documents

Each document has a Name and an External ID which are initially populated with the name of the file that you upload.

Name - Human readable text which is how the document will be visible in Vellum's UI (in documents tab)

External ID - As the contents of a document change and the old documents becomes out of date, you can submit the updated document
for reindexing re-uploading it and specifying the same \`External ID\`.",
