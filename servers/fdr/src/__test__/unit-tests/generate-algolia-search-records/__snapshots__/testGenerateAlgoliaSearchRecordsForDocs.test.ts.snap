 1. When a patient signs up or schedules an appointment, Eligibility [../api-reference/eligibility] is used to run a real-time
    eligibility check to confirm the patient's medical coverage.
 2. A day before the patient's appointment, Eligibility [../api-reference/eligibility] is used again to re-confirm the patient's
    coverage. It may have lapsed since they scheduled the appointment.
 3. After visit has been completed, an Encounter [../api-reference/encounters] is submitted to Candid. This either happens in
    real-time immediately when the visit is completed and/or signed, or in a batch job at the end of the day.
 4. Exports [../api-reference/exports] are downloaded and processed daily. Patient payments are sent to collect the balance owed

request to create an Encounter.


PREREQUISITES

 * Python 3.x or TypeScript 4.x installed on your system
 * Candid Client ID
 * Candid Client Secret


INSTALLATION

First, install the SDK using your package manager: bash pip install candidhealth # or poetry install, etc bash yarn add
candidhealth # or npm install, pnpm i, etc.


AUTHENTICATION

To make requests to our API, you'll need to use your API key for authentication. Initialize the SDK as follows:

\`\`\`python from candid.client import CandidApiClient from candid.environment import CandidApiEnvironment

client = CandidApiClient(
    environment=CandidApiEnvironment.STAGING,
    options=CandidApiClientOptions(
        client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    )
)
\`\`\`
</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
\`\`\`typescript
import { CandidApi, CandidApiClient, CandidApiEnvironment } from "candidhealth";

const client = new CandidApiClient({
    environment: CandidApiEnvironment.Staging,
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
});
\`\`\`
</CodeBlock>


Candid provides two environments, STAGING and PRODUCTION. Take care to pass the correct environment when creating your API client
so that requests are routed correctly.


MAKING AN EXAMPLE REQUEST

In this example, we'll create an Encounter using the V4 API.

\`\`\`python created_encounter = client.encounters.v_4.create( external_id=EncounterExternalId("emr-claim-id-abcd",
date_of_service=Date("2023-05-23", billable_status=BillableStatusType.BILLABLE, # or BillableStatusType.NOT_BILLABLE
responsible_party=ResponsiblePartyType.INSURANCE_PAY, # or ResponsiblePartyType.SELF_PAY patient=PatientCreate(

benefitsAssignedToProvider: true, }); \`\`\`


ERROR HANDLING

Each endpoint in our SDK documents which errors and exceptions can be raised if the request fails. These can be caught and handled
via native exception-handling:

\`\`\`python from candid.resources.encounters.resources.v_4.errors import EncounterExternalIdUniquenessError

try:
    created_encounter = client.encounters.v_4.create(...)
except EncounterExternalIdUniquenessError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
\`\`\`
</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
\`\`\`typescript
if (createEncounterResponse.ok) {
    const { body: newEncounter } = createEncounterResponse;
    console.log(newEncounter.encounterId);
} else {
    console.error(createEncounterResponse.error);
}
\`\`\`

WHAT IS A BREAKING CHANGE

We consider a break any change that meets one of the two following criteria:

 * A schema change to a request shape that leads to a previously valid client request shape becoming invalid.
 * A schema change to a response shape that leads to a previously valid client response parser becoming invalid.

Here are some examples of changes that we consider non-breaking:

 * Adding a new field to an existing response shape
 * Making a required field on a request shape optional
 * Removing an optional field on a response shape

Here are some examples of changes that we consider breaking:

 * Removing a required field on a response shape
 * Changing the data type of a field",

we brand decimal strings with the type \`Decimal\` to indicate that the server will parse them into Python
Decimal objects.

PAGINATION

We use pagination in our API to make sure that we don't return too much data at once. Many of our endpoints return an extension of
the ResourcePage type:

ResourcePage:
  items: T[]
  next_page_token: PageToken | None
  prev_page_token: PageToken | None



DECIMALS

We avoid using floating-point arithmetic that leads to imprecision. Instead, we use the Decimal type, which is a string alias type
that represents a decimal number as a string. These decimal strings are parsed into the Python Decimal class
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal-objects].


UNIONS

We use unions to represent a type that can be one of several different types. When a union shape is used, our union discriminant
will always be the type field unless otherwise specified.

We also expect that it is a non-breaking change to add a new union member to a union type. This means that if you handle a union

API VERSIONS

Primer makes updates to the APIs on a regular basis, as we release new features. To allow you to update your integration as you
are ready, we allow for a X-Api-Version header to be passed on all API requests.

If you omit the version header, your request will default to the earliest supported version of the API.

curl -X POST 'https://api.primer.io/<ENDPOINT>' \\
  --header 'X-Api-Version: 2.2'

MANAGING API KEYS

Head up to the Developers area [https://sandbox-dashboard.primer.io/developers] on the dashboard to manage your API keys.

You will be able to generate or revoke API keys and edit their respective scopes. Be aware that any changes to existing API keys
will be reflected immediately and could cause unwanted side effects.

ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

{
  "error": {
    "errorId": "AnErrorId",
    "description": "A human description of the error.",
    "diagnosticsId": "1234567890",
    "validationErrors": []
  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into
your account. DECLINED This payment was declined by the processor, either at a gateway or acquirer level. See the reason object in
your response payload for more details. CANCELLED The payment was cancelled prior to it being settled.

If this is the case, make another request with the same idempotency key:

MIGRATING TO V2.1

The latest version of our APIs focus on capturing more details to enable a richer checkout experience. Some of these details are
required to allow configuration of the checkout via the Primer Dashboard. Also some of these details are needed to work with
advanced Payment Processors or Payment Methods.

The examples below only illustrate how to transition between the two versions of the endpoints, however you should read the latest
API Reference linked above for details on the usage of the endpoints. Also read how to introduce API Versioning into your requests
in the latest API Reference linked above.

ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

{
  "error": {
    "errorId": "AnErrorId",
    "description": "A human description of the error.",
    "diagnosticsId": "1234567890",
    "validationErrors": []
  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into
your account. DECLINED This payment was declined by the processor, either at a gateway or acquirer level. See the reason object in
your response payload for more details. CANCELLED The payment was cancelled prior to it being settled.

ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

{
  "error": {
    "errorId": "AnErrorId",
    "description": "A human description of the error.",
    "diagnosticsId": "1234567890",
    "validationErrors": []
  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into

JINJA TEMPLATING

Jinja is a powerful templating syntax useful for dynamic content. Most commonly, you’ll use it to reference Prompt Variables.
Below are the most common things you’re likely to want to do, but you can find jinja’s complete documentation here

VARIABLES

Reference variables using double-curly-brackets. For example,

\`\`\` You are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant. \`\`\` Note that all variables are treated as strings!


CONDITIONALS

Perform conditional logic based on your input variables using if/else statements

\`\`\` You are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant. {% if personality_type == "rude" %} You end every message with a frowning
emoji. {% else %} You end every message with a smiling emoji. {% endif %} \`\`\`


COMMENTS

HISTORY

Every model generated response and respective prompt are saved as history items, giving you access to a detailed record of your
work. To access history items, simply activate the toggle button located at the top right of the Playground, and all history items
will appear on the left side of your screen.

SAVE, COLLABORATION, AND TAGS

The Playground is designed to help you iterate on prompts and model providers until you find the perfect fit for your needs. With
the history feature, you can keep track of your team's work in an organized way by only keeping the iterations you choose to,
through the save button.

Everyone working on the same sandbox can see each other's history items, and you can also tag them to keep better track of your
work.

WHAT IS A DOCUMENT INDEX?

Document indexes act as a collection of documents grouped together for performing searches against for a specific use case. For
example, if you are creating a chatbot to query against OpenAI’s help center documents, the text files of each article in the help
center would be stored in one index. Here's how it looks in Vellum's UI:
