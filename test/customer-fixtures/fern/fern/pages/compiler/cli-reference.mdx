## `fern generate [--group <group>] [--version <version>]`

`fern generate` runs the compiler. It will validate your API and run the
generators specified in `generators.yml`.

If you don't have a `default-group` specified in `generators.yml`, then you must
specify a group using the `--group` option.

You can specify a version using the `--version` option. This version string is
used when publishing SDKs to registries (e.g., npm).

### Running locally

By default, the generation runs in the cloud. If you want to run it on your local machine, you can use the `--local` option. This will run each generator in a Docker container.

By default, Fern will delete the container after running. To keep the container around (e.g., to look at the generator's logs), use the `--keepDocker` option.

## `fern check`

`fern check` will validate that your API is valid.

## `fern write-definition`

`fern write-definition` will convert your OpenAPI spec into a Fern definition. You'll see a new folder called `definition` created.

```
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json
    └─ definition/ <--- your Fern definition
        └─ api.yml
        └─ __package__.yml
```

When you have an `openapi` folder and a `definition` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI spec. Remove the `openapi` folder if you'd like to use generators with your Fern definition.

## `fern upgrade`

`fern upgrade` will upgrade your compiler version in `fern.config.json` to the
latest version.

## `fern add <generator>`

`fern add` adds a new generator to your `generators.yml`. You can view the full
list of supported generators in the [Generators](/generators) section.

## `fern init`

`fern init` adds a new API to your repo.

## `fern register`

_Advanced feature._ You can register your API so it can be depended on by other
APIs. Read more in the [Depending on other APIs](../advanced/depending-on-other-apis.mdx) section.
