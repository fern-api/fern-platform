**Fern is an open source toolkit for designing, building, and consuming REST APIs.**

## Capabilities

1. ðŸ“– **SDKs**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, Go
2. ðŸ“œ **Documentation**: API docs website, Postman collection
3. ðŸ’» **Server-side code**: Express, FastAPI, Spring

## OpenAPI Compatability
