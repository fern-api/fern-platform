Types describe the data model of your API.

## Built-in types

- **`string`**
- **`integer`**
- **`long`**
- **`double`**
- **`boolean`**
- **`datetime`** _An [RFC 3339, section 5.6 datetime](https://ijmacd.github.io/rfc3339-iso8601/). For example, `2017-07-21T17:32:28Z`._
- **`date`** _An RFC 3339, section 5.6 date (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, `2017-07-21`._
- **`uuid`**
- **`base64`**
- **`list`** _e.g., list\<string\>_
- **`set`** _e.g., set\<string\>_
- **`map`** _e.g., map\<string, integer\>_
- **`optional`** _e.g., optional\<string\>_
- **`unknown`** _Represents arbitrary JSON._

## Custom types

Creating your own types is easy in Fern!

### Objects

The most common custom types are **objects**.

In Fern, you use the `"properties"` key to create an object:

```yaml
types:
  Person:
    properties: # <---
      name: string
      address: Address

  Address:
    properties: # <---
      line1: string
      line2: optional<string>
      city: string
      state: string
      zip: string
```

These represent JSON objects:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Happy Lane",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
```

You can also use **extends** to compose objects:

```yaml
types:
  Pet:
    properties:
      name: string
  Dog:
    extends: Pet
    properties:
      breed: string
```

### Aliases

An Alias type is a renaming of an existing type. This is usually done for clarity.

```yaml
types:
  # UserId is an alias of string
  UserId: string

  User:
    properties:
      id: UserId
      name: string
```

### Enums

An enum represents a string with a set of allowed values.

In Fern, you use the `"enum"` key to create an enum:

```yaml
types:
  WeatherReport:
    enum: # <---
      - SUNNY
      - CLOUDY
      - RAINING
      - SNOWING
```

### Unions

Fern supports tagged unions (a.k.a. discriminated unions). Unions are useful for
polymorphism. This is similar to the `oneOf` concept in OpenAPI.

In Fern, you use the `"union"` key to create an union:

```yaml
types:
  Animal:
    union:
      dog: Dog
      cat: Cat
  Dog:
    properties:
      likesToWoof: boolean
  Cat:
    properties:
      likesToMeow: boolean
```

In JSON, unions have a **discriminant property** to differentiate between
different members of the union. By default, Fern uses `"type"` as the
discriminant property:

```json
{
  "type": "dog",
  "likesToWoof": true
}
```

You can customize the discriminant property using the "discriminant" key:

```diff
 types:
   Animal:
+    discriminant: animalType
     union:
       dog: Dog
       cat: Cat
   Dog:
     properties:
       likesToWoof: boolean
   Cat:
     properties:
       likesToMeow: boolean
```

This corresponds to a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "animalType": "dog",
  "likesToWoof": true
}
```

You can also have a union without a discriminant.

```
MyUnion:
  discriminated: false
  union:
    - string
    - integer
```

### Documentation

You can add documentation for types. These docs are passed into the compiler,
and are incredibly useful in the generated outputs (e.g., docstrings in SDKs).

```yaml
types:
  Person:
    docs: A person represents a human being
    properties:
      name: string
      age:
        docs: age in years
        type: integer
```

```typescript Generated TypeScript SDK
/**
 * A person represents a human being
 */
interface Person {
  name: string;
  // age in years
  age: number;
}
```

### Examples

You can add examples for types. These are passed into the compiler to be used in
the generated outputs (e.g., examples in the Postman collection).

```yaml
types:
  UserId:
    docs: A unique identifier for a user
    type: string
    examples:
      - value: user-id-123
```

```typescript Generated TypeScript SDK
/**
 * A unique identifier for a user
 *
 * @example "user-id-123"
 */
type UserId = string;
```

The Fern compiler validates that your examples match the expected types. For
example, this won't compile:

```yaml
types:
  UserId:
    type: integer
    examples:
      - value: hello # not an integer
```

#### Referencing examples from other types

Just like types, you can compose examples. To reference an example from another
type, use `$`.

```yaml
types:
  UserId:
    type: integer
    examples:
      - name: Example1
        value: user-id-123

  User:
    properties:
      id: UserId
      name: string
    examples:
      - value:
          id: $UserId.Example1 # <---
          name: Jane Smith
```
