Welcome to Fern's API documentation! Here you'll find information about the various endpoints available to you,
as well as the parameters and responses that they accept and return.

### API Stability

Some of the APIs documented within are undergoing active development. Use the <Availability type="beta" /> and <Availability type="GA"/>
tags to differentiate between those that are stable and those that are not. GA stands for generally available.

### Official API Clients

Vellum maintains official API clients for Python and Node/Typescript. We recommend using these clients to interact
with all stable endpoints. You can find them here:
