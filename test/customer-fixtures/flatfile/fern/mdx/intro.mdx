The Flatfile API uses REST. Our API is designed to have predictable resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. It accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Flatfile API doesn't have a test mode; however, Environments allow you to test without affecting your live data.
