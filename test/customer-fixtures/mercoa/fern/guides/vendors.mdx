# Vendor Network

Entities in Mercoa have access to a vendor network, which is accessible for each entity using the [counterparty](/api-reference/counterparty/find-counterparty) endpoint.

There are three levels of network:

| Network Level | Description                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Entity`      | Vendors who have been paid by the entity before or explicitly linked to the entity.   |
| `Platform`    | Vendors who have been paid by any entity in your organization                         |
| `Mercoa`      | Vendors who have been verified by Mercoa and shared with all Mercoa partner platforms |

# Creating Vendors

If you are using the [API](/home/api-quick-start) or need to import vendors from an existing system, you need to create the vendor [entity](/concepts/entities) and link them to the appropriate payer or payers.

## Creating the Vendor Entity

Using the [create entity](/api-reference/entity/create-entity) endpoint, create a new entity, and make sure the following are set

```ts
{
  isPayee: true; // This marks the entity as able to receive funds
  isPayor: false; // This marks the entity as unable to pay funds
  ownedByOrg: false; // This indicated that you don't have a direct relationship with this entity (aka, they are your customer's vendor)
}
```

This will automatically add the entity to the `platform` network.

## Capturing Vendor Details

If you don't have the vendor's details, you can use the [generate onboarding link](/api-reference/entity/generate-onboarding-link) endpoint to create a link that the vendor can use to provide their details. This link will be valid for 24 hours. You can also use the [send onboarding link](/api-reference/entity/send-onboarding-link) endpoint to send the link to the vendor via email. This link will be valid for 7 days, and will be emailed to the entity email.

You can configure what details are required for the vendor using the [dashboard](https://mercoa.com/dashboard/developers#branding) or [api](/api-reference/organization/update-current-organization).

## Explicitly adding the vendor to the entity network

When a vendor is paid by a entity, they are automatically added to the `entity` network.
However, you can explicitly link the vendor to any entity using the [add payees](/api-reference/entity/add-payees) endpoint.

If an entity is creating a vendor to pay later, you will **almost always** want to use the [add payees](/api-reference/entity/add-payees) endpoint to create the payer/vendor relationship.
