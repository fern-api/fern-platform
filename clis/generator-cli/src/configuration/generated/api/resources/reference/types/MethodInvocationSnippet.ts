/**
 * The method invocation snippet is one which appears when the endpoint's reference is collapsed.
 * It is meant to give a high-level overview of the endpoint -- e.g. the method name and it's return value.
 * The snippet itself should be a list of concatable content, which the CLI will handle hyperlinking. Note that this
 * will essentially just be a "".join(snippetParts), so you must handle making sure the right `.`, etc. are in the parts.
 * Note this is a separate object to make it easier to add additional properties down the road, for example if
 * we wanted to be specific about what portion of the snippet we hyperlink, etc.
