title: Managed Gas
---

Managing gas balances is not only cumbersome but also can lead to stuck or failed transactions that significantly impact your end users’ experience. Syndicate’s Managed Gas feature eliminates the need to worry about gas and operates efficiently in the background, simplifying your transactions.

How it works:

- **Continuous monitoring & threshold detection**

  The system continually monitors your wallet’s gas balance, keeping a
  close eye on available resources. When your gas balance falls below a
  predefined threshold, the Managed Gas system triggers a gas refill.

- **Automated gas**

  Syndicate automatically adds the required gas to your wallet, ensuring
  that you always have enough for your transactions.

- **Seamless transactions**

  With this feature in place, you can confidently send transactions
  without the worry of running out of gas, providing a reliable and hassle-free
  experience.

Syndicate’s Managed Gas feature is only available for our paid customers. [Contact us](https://syndicate.io/contact-us) to learn more.
