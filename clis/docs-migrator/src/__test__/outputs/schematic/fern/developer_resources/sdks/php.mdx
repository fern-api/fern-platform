### Installation

The PHP SDK is hosted [here](https://github.com/SchematicHQ/schematic-php). To install the bindings via Composer, add the following to composer.json to list the repository as a source:

```php
"repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/SchematicHQ/schematic-php.git"
    }
  ]
```

Then, run the following:

```bash
composer require schematichq/schematic-php
```

### Initialization

Initialize a client with an [API key secret](/quickstart#create-an-api-key).

```php
use Schematic;

$schematic_companies = new Schematic\Api\CompaniesApi(Schematic\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()
          ->setApiKey('X-Schematic-Api-Key', "sch_dev_yourapikey"))
```

That will create an instance of `schematic_companies` that you can use to interact with the initialized resource. Other resources can be initialized in a similar manner.

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example of upserting a Company (creating or updating it).

```php
try {
    $schematic_companies->createCompany([
        "keys" => [
            "id" => $this->id,
        ],
        "name" => $this->name,
        "traits" => [
            "uuid" => $this->uuid,
            "account_id" => $this->account_id,
            "subscription_tier" => $this->subscription_tier,
            "subscription_quantity" => $this->subscription_quantity,
            "trial_end_time" => $this->trial_end_time,
        ],
    ]);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    report($e);
}
```
