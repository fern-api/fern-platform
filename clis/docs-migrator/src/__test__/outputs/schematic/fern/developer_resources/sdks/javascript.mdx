### Installation

The `schematic-js` SDK is hosted [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@schematichq/schematic-js). Use npm or your preferred package manager to install:

```bash
npm install @schematichq/schematic-js
```

Once installed, you can submit requests using your [publishable key](/quickstart#create-an-api-key).

If you prefer to install the client-side JavaScript library using a script tag, you can load it from our CDN using the following URL: [https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js](https://cdn.schematichq.com/js/schematic.js)

### Initialization

Initialize the SDK in the following way:

```javascript
var schematic = new Schematic("your-api-key");
```

### Usage example

Once the SDK is initialized, you may submit requests. Below is an example of identifying a user and submitting a usage event to Schematic.

```javascript
// Send an identify event
const userId = "my-user-id";
const keys = {
  id: userId,
};
const traits = {
  anykey: "anyval",
};
const company = {
  name: "My Company",
  keys: {
    id: "my-company-id",
  },
  traits: {
    location: "Atlanta, GA",
  }
};
schematic.identify({ keys, traits, company });

// Send a track event
const event = "query";
const traits = {};
const company = {};
const user = {};

schematic.track({
  event: "query",
  traits: {
      feature: "feat_cns2asuKAG2",
  },
  company: {
    id: "my-company-id",
  },
  user: {
    id: "my-user-id",
  },
});
```

The Javasript SDK references companies or users by their Schematic ID using the `id` key or by any key you have defined and passed to Schematic previously.

### React Native

This library uses [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid). In order for this to work in a React native context, you must also provide a [shim](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values#readme) for crypto.getRandomValues as described in the [uuid documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid#react-native--expo).
