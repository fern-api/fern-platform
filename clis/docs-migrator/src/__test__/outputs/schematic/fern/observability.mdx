All events sent to Schematic are available in the Events tab to users. The latest flag evaluation is visible in the UI as it occurs to determine when the evaluation occurred and how Schematic evaluated the flag.

The Audit Log is also available within Settings, which shows the following separated by environment:
- A log of actions taken by users within Schematic
- A log of create, update, and delete API requests

Schematic uses external services to monitor infrastructure and alert in case of an unexpected outage. Uptime reporting is available [here](https://schematic.statuspage.io/). 

The team is on call 24/7 and can be reached either in Slack or at `support@schematichq.com`.
