title: The Event object
subtitle: null
slug: api-reference/events/event
---


The `Event` object describes events from your application that can be associated with `Users` , `Companies`, and `Features`. A new `Event` is created when it is submitted via the API. 

Events are typically sent to Schematic to create or update `Users` or `Companies` (identify events), or to log usage events (track events) for usage analytics or metering.

Track events can have any number of subtypes denoting what event is being tracked (e.g. `query_run`, `endpoint_added`, etc.). Properties (e.g. `num_users`, `num_endpoints`, etc.) can be `Events` but we recommend they be submitted as traits on the `Company` and `User` objects.

**Attributes**

<ParamField path="id" type="string">
Unique `id` generated by Schematic for the object.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="feature_id" type="string">
The Schematic `id` associated with the feature tied to the event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="user_id" type="string">
The Schematic `id` associated with the user tied to the event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="company_id" type="string">
The Schematic `id` associated with the company tied to the event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sent_at" type="datetime">
Datetime when event was sent to Schematic. Format is ISO 8601.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="captured_at" type="datetime">
Datetime when event was received by Schematic. Format is ISO 8601.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="loaded_at" type="datetime">
Datetime when event was loaded into the Schematic database. Format is ISO 8601.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="enriched_at" type="datetime">
Datetime when event was associated with objects in Schematic. Format is ISO 8601.
