The `User` object describes users within your application. A new User is created when it is submitted with `keys` via the API or, if connected and mapped, via third party integrations (e.g. provisioning new users on an existing company). Users may be updated in a similar fashion.

An `id` is auto-generated for each `User` , but they can also have 1 or many `keys` , which serve as unique identifiers that can be referenced via the API or by other systems when creating, retrieving, or updating a `User` in Schematic.
