The `Company` object describes companies within your application. A new `Company` is created when it is submitted via the API or, if connected and mapped, via third party integrations (e.g. provisioning a new company after a sale). Companies may be updated in a similar fashion.

An `id` is auto-generated for each `Company` , but they can also have 1 or many `keys` , which serve as unique identifiers that can be referenced via the API or by other systems when creating, retrieving, or updating a `Company` in Schematic.
