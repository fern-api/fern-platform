    <Accordion title="2) Create a project">

        1. Click the "Create project" button on the top right hand side of your dashboard
        2. Add your project name, environment type, and network
        3. Upon creation, an API key and transaction wallet will be generated for you automatically. If you ever need to, in the future, you can add additional networks. [Contact us to learn more](https://syndicate.io/contact-us).

      </Accordion>

<Accordion title="3) Add funds to your transaction wallet">
  You’ll need to add tokens to your transaction wallet in order to broadcast your first transaction.
                  - Within your new project, select the “Wallets & Gas” tab
                    - **If your transaction wallet is on a testnet**, first find a faucet and add your testnet tokens to your new transaction broadcasting wallet. Here are a few faucets to check out:
                      - [faucet.triangleplatform.com](https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/)
                      - [faucet.quicknode.com](https://faucet.quicknode.com/drip)
                      - [sepolia faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)
                    - **If your transaction wallet is on a mainnet**, you’ll need to acquire mainnet tokens yourself
                    
                    
Manually topping up transaction broadcasting wallets to handle gas costs can be a nuisance. If you’re interested in having Syndicate manage gas for you, [reach out to us](https://syndicate.io/contact-us).

      <Accordion title="4) Use Syndicate API to call a test contract">


Use the script below to mint an NFT from one of our test contracts:

            ```json
            curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY' \
            -H "Content-type: application/json" \
            -d '{
            "projectId": "PROJECT_ID",
            "contractAddress": "CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
            "chainId": CHAIN_ID,
            "functionSignature": "mint(address account)",
            "args": {
              "account": "0xAddressToReceiveNFT",
            }
            }' \
            'https://api.syndicate.io/transact/sendTransaction'

            ```

Be sure to replace `API_KEY`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `CHAIN_ID`, `0xAddressToReceiveNFT`, according to your project’s credentials. Replace `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with one of the test contracts corresponding to your project.
