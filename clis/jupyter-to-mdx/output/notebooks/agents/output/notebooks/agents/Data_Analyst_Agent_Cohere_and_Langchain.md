# Tool Use - Simple Data Analyst Agent with Cohere and Langchain

Tool use is a method whichs allows developers to connect Cohere's Command models to external tools like search engines, APIs, databases, and other software tools. Just like how [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) allows a model to use an external data source to improve factual generation, tool use is a capability that allows retrieving data from multiple sources. But it goes beyond simply retrieving information and is able to use software tools to execute code, or even create entries in a CRM system.

In this notebook, we'll see how we can use two tools to create a simple data analyst agent that is able to search the web and run code in a python interpreter. This agent uses Cohere's Command R+ mode and Langchain.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/main/notebooks/images/tool-use-notebook-header.png)

# Environment
Let's start by installing the required libraries


```python
! pip install --quiet langchain langchain_cohere langchain_experimental
```

## Setup
We'll need a Cohere API key here. Grab your key and paste it in the next slide if you have one, or [register](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/register) and create a new API key.


```python
### LLMs
import os
os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'] = "<INSERT COHERE API KEY HERE>"
```


```python
# Create the Cohere chat model
from langchain_cohere.chat_models import ChatCohere
chat = ChatCohere(model="command-r-plus", temperature=0.3)
```

# Define tools
Our simple data analyst will be equipped with a web search tool, and a python interpreter (which we can use to run plotting code, for example).

### Web search
Let's first equip our agent with web search! We can use the Tivaly API for this. Head on to [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) and grab an API key to use here.


```python
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = "<INSERT TAVILY API KEY HERE>"

internet_search = TavilySearchResults()
internet_search.name = "internet_search"
internet_search.description = "Returns a list of relevant document snippets for a textual query retrieved from the internet."


from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class TavilySearchInput(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(description="Query to search the internet with")
internet_search.args_schema = TavilySearchInput
```

### Python interpreter tool
Let's equip our agent with a python interpreter!


```python
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL

python_repl = PythonREPL()
repl_tool = Tool(
    name="python_repl",
    description="Executes python code and returns the result. The code runs in a static sandbox without interactive mode, so print output or save output to a file.",
    func=python_repl.run,
)
repl_tool.name = "python_interpreter"

# from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class ToolInput(BaseModel):
    code: str = Field(description="Python code to execute.")
repl_tool.args_schema = ToolInput

```


```python

```

# Create ReAct Agent: the data analyst


```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_cohere.react_multi_hop.agent import create_cohere_react_agent
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
```


```python
# Create the prompt
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("{input}")


# Create the ReAct agent
agent = create_cohere_react_agent(
    llm=chat,
    tools=[internet_search, repl_tool],
    prompt=prompt,
)
```


```python
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[internet_search, repl_tool], verbose=True)
```

# Let's ask a question to the data analyst


```python
agent_executor.invoke({
    "input": "Create a plot of the number of full time employees at the 3 tech companies with the highest market cap in the United States in 2024.",
})
```

    First, I will search for the three tech companies with the highest market cap in the US in 2024. Then, I will search for the number of full-time employees at each of these companies, and plot the data using Python.

This is a simple example to get you start. There [are many tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/) you can equip your agent with. Once youre comfortable with these ideas, you can also proceed to define your tools (see [Multi-step tool use in Action](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multi-step-tool-use#multi-step-tool-use-in-action)).
