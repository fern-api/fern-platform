# How to use ReadMe to Fern Migrator

To run the ReadMe migrator:

1. Export ReadMe documentation
   1. Go to project page
   1. Navigate to **Configuration** -> **Project Settings**
   1. Scroll to the **Project Management** section
   1. Click the button to **Export Docs**
1. Unzip file
1. Run migrator using `npm run migrate`
1. When prompted, enter the path to the unzipped docs file
1. The migrator will then prompt you to specify which folders you would like to migrate to Fern docs.

Successfully converted files will be stored in a _pages_ folder, and any corresponding images will be stored in an _images_ folder.

To integrate the pages into a Fern-generated site:

1. Follow the [directions](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/getting-started/quickstart) for setting up documentation
1. Copy the contents of the _pages_ folder generated by the migrator into the _fern/docs/pages_ folder in your fern docs
1. Move the **entire** _images_ folder into the _fern/docs/assets_ folder in your fern docs

Remaining set up steps (to be automated in a later update):

- The site navigation must be set up in the `docs.yml` file (this includes fixing url slugs)
- Links which reference the internal documentation must be fixed
- Some custom elements (e.g. `[block:html]`), if present in the docs, will need to be converted manually to embedded HTML
