 * Production: https://api.primer.io [https://api.primer.io]


API VERSIONS

Primer makes updates to the APIs on a regular basis, as we release new features. To allow you to update your integration as you
are ready, we allow for a X-Api-Version header to be passed on all API requests.

If you omit the version header, your request will default to the earliest supported version of the API.

curl -X POST 'https://api.primer.io/<ENDPOINT>' \\\\
  --header 'X-Api-Version: 2.2'

[https://sandbox-dashboard.primer.io/developers] area of the dashboard.

As API keys carry many privileges such as authorizing payments, it is important to keep them private and secure. Do not hardcode
or share API keys (particularly in your source version control system), and they should only be used in your backend.

Authentication is handled via HTTP headers, specifically the X-Api-Key header.

curl -X POST 'https://api.primer.io/<ENDPOINT>' \\\\
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'



MANAGING API KEYS

Head up to the Developers area [https://sandbox-dashboard.primer.io/developers] on the dashboard to manage your API keys.

You will be able to generate or revoke API keys and edit their respective scopes. Be aware that any changes to existing API keys
will be reflected immediately and could cause unwanted side effects.


AVAILABLE SCOPES

Scope Description client_tokens:write Create client tokens for use with the client SDK. third_party:webhook_trigger Allows you to
post to our webhooks endpoint. API keys with this scope can be used to enable communication between your processor and Primer
about important payment lifecycle events. transactions:authorize Authorize a payment transactions:cancel Cancel a payment.
transactions:capture Submit a payment for settlement. transactions:retrieve Retrieve one or more payments. transactions:refund
Refund a payment. payment_instrument:read Read stored payment methods. payment_instrument:write Write stored payment methods.",

The following table summarizes the HTTP response codes you may receive from the Primer REST API.

Status Code Description 200 Success 400 Bad Request 401 Unauthorized 403 Forbidden 404 Entity Not Found 409 Entity Already Exists
422 Input Validation Failed


ERROR RESPONSES

Primer uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. HTTP codes in the 2XX range
indicate a successful request, whereas codes in the 4XX range indicate a failed request usually due to invalid inputs or
operations.

The format of the payload for all errors is common. When an unsuccessful request occurs, you will receive a payload in the
following format:

{
  \\"error\\": {
    \\"errorId\\": \\"AnErrorId\\",
    \\"description\\": \\"A human description of the error.\\",
    \\"diagnosticsId\\": \\"1234567890\\",
    \\"validationErrors\\": []
  }
}


All error payloads will be comprised of a unique errorId which you can use to identify the error, a human description description,
and a diagnosticsId that you can quote when contacting the support team (support@primer.io [support@primer.io]). In case of a
badly formed request, Primer will also return additional validationErrors.


PAYMENT STATUS

As the payments are created, processed, and finalised, they go through a number of states that you will get as an API response,
through webhook notifications, and in the Dashboard. These states are used across all processors, as processor specific states are
mapped to these. An additional message, in the field processorMessage, from the processor may also be included that details the
reason for the state, primarily on failure states.

Status Description PENDING The payment has been created by Primer but not yet authorized. FAILED The processor failed to process
this payment. AUTHORIZED The payment is authorized and awaiting capture. SETTLING The payment has been submitted for settlement
and funds will be settled later. PARTIALLY_SETTLED The payment has been partially settled. SETTLED Funds have been settled into
your account. DECLINED This payment was declined by the processor, either at a gateway or acquirer level. See the reason object in
your response payload for more details. CANCELLED The payment was cancelled prior to it being settled.

    "path": "v-2-2/introduction/idempotency-key",
    "subtitle": "Primer supports a request idempotency mechanism for our Payments API. This optional feature enables you to safely retry a request
without risking the user being charged or refunded multiple times.

This is particularly useful when an API call fails due to the request being invalid, due to a network issue, or if Primer is
momentarily unavailable.

If this is the case, make another request with the same idempotency key:

 * If a request with the same idempotency key has already been successfully processed by Primer, the new request will be ignored.
   A 400 error will be returned with an errorId set to TransactionRequestIdempotencyKeyAlreadyExists.
 * Otherwise, Primer will attempt to process the new request.

To make an idempotent request, generate an idempotency key and pass it to the header X-Idempotency-Key.

curl -X POST 'https://api.primer.io/<ENDPOINT>' \\\\
  --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: <idempotency-key>'


The way you generate the key is totally up to you, as long as it is unique per request attempt.

Keep in mind that a payment request resulting in a declined or failed payment is still considered Successfully processed for the
API. Therefore, if you want to allow the user to retry an unsuccessful payment, make sure to not use the same idempotency key.

As a such, don't use anything too restrictive like an orderId for the idempotency key as multiple payment attempts and refunds can
be made for a single order.",

MIGRATING TO V2.1

The latest version of our APIs focus on capturing more details to enable a richer checkout experience. Some of these details are
required to allow configuration of the checkout via the Primer Dashboard. Also some of these details are needed to work with
advanced Payment Processors or Payment Methods.

The examples below only illustrate how to transition between the two versions of the endpoints, however you should read the latest
API Reference linked above for details on the usage of the endpoints. Also read how to introduce API Versioning into your requests
in the latest API Reference linked above.

    "subtitle": "When using an LLM, you input a prompt and get back a completion. However, in order for a prompt to be reusable, you’ll want to be
able to specify certain parts of it dynamically.

That’s where prompt templates come in. Prompt templates contain the fixed parts of a prompt with placeholders for the parts that
might change from run to run. When you use a prompt template, you pass in specific values for the placeholders to create the final
prompt that’s sent to the LLM.

Vellum’s Prompt Syntax supports dynamically constructed prompts via jinja templating
[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/] and what we call “blocks.”


JINJA TEMPLATING

Jinja is a powerful templating syntax useful for dynamic content. Most commonly, you’ll use it to reference Prompt Variables.
Below are the most common things you’re likely to want to do, but you can find jinja’s complete documentation here
[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/].


VARIABLES

Reference variables using double-curly-brackets. For example,

\`\`\` You are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant. \`\`\` Note that all variables are treated as strings!


CONDITIONALS

Perform conditional logic based on your input variables using if/else statements

\`\`\` You are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant. {% if personality_type == \\"rude\\" %} You end every message with a frowning
emoji. {% else %} You end every message with a smiling emoji. {% endif %} \`\`\`


COMMENTS

You can use jinja to leave comments in your prompt that don’t use up any tokens when compiled and sent to the LLM. For example,

\`\`\` {# This is a comment #} Hello, world! \`\`\`",

HISTORY

Every model generated response and respective prompt are saved as history items, giving you access to a detailed record of your
work. To access history items, simply activate the toggle button located at the top right of the Playground, and all history items
will appear on the left side of your screen.

SAVE, COLLABORATION, AND TAGS

The Playground is designed to help you iterate on prompts and model providers until you find the perfect fit for your needs. With
the history feature, you can keep track of your team's work in an organized way by only keeping the iterations you choose to,
through the save button.

Everyone working on the same sandbox can see each other's history items, and you can also tag them to keep better track of your
work.

WHAT IS A DOCUMENT INDEX?

Document indexes act as a collection of documents grouped together for performing searches against for a specific use case. For
example, if you are creating a chatbot to query against OpenAI’s help center documents, the text files of each article in the help
center would be stored in one index. Here's how it looks in Vellum's UI:

Welcome to Vellum's API documentation! Here you'll find information about the various endpoints available to you, as well as the
parameters and responses that they accept and return.

We will be exposing more and more of our APIs over time as they stabilize. If there is some action you can perform via the UI that
you wish you could perform via API, please let us know and we can expose it here in an unstable state.


API STABILITY

Some of the APIs documented within are undergoing active development. Use the <strong style={{ backgroundColor: \\"#4caf50\\", color:
\\"white\\", padding: 4, borderRadius: 4 }}>Stable and <strong style={{ backgroundColor: \\"#ffc107\\", color: \\"white\\", padding: 4,
borderRadius: 4 }}>Unstable tags to differentiate between those that are stable and those that are not.


BASE URLS

Some endpoints are hosted separately from the main Vellum API and therefore have a different base url. If this is the case, they
will say so in their description.

Unless otherwise specified, all endpoints use https://api.vellum.ai as their base URL.
