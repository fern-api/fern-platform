# 2024-02-28

- Fixed [scrolling issue in mobile](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-ui/commit/a0dbc6195c3de6c2145dce32baf1826bb6b99c25).
- Fixed random navigation regressions due to major shiki-related refactor.

# 2024-02-27

- Resolved issues with shiki syntax highlighter causing the page to crash on some code samples because the server-generated HAST was too large. Switching to client-side rendering for code samples to avoid this issue.
- Resolved issues with scrolling navigation issues due to updated code sample rendering. There's still an outstanding bug with scrolling on mobile, which is currently jumpy and still being investigated.
- Added Changelog Page under API sections. See [#469](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-ui/pull/469)

# 2024-02-26

- Replaced `react-syntax-highlighter` with [`shiki`](https://shiki.style/) for better performance syntax highlighting. See [#463](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-ui/pull/463) for more details.

# 2024-02-23

- Replaced FernMenu with FernDropdown for better accessibility and cleaner/consistent visual style. This affects the version dropdown and code sample dropdown.
- Hide Python Async example (for now) until we can provide a better selection state.
- When a language selection is changed, maintain the same visual scroll position by measuring the scroll position before and after the change.
- Added Go SDK to the code snippet language selection.
- Replaced the custom implementation of code snippets rendering for JSON and cURL with default syntax highlighter to improve performance and reduce complexity.
- Icon is now available as a markdown component. Usage (color and size are optional):

```markdown
<Icon icon="check" color="green" size={4} />
```
