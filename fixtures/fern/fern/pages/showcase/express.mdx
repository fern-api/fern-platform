Fern has a first-class integration with Express. Fern automatically generates:

- Typescript interfaces for your API types
- Exceptions that you can throw for non-200 responses
- Interfaces for you to define your business logic.

All the networking/HTTP logic is auto-generated by Fern under the hood.

The [Fern Express Starter](https://github.com/fern-api/express-starter) is a simple example of a Fern-powered Express server.
