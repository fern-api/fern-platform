In the root of the `fern/` directory is a special file `fern.config.json`.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json # <---
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ api.yml
    └─ imdb.yml
```

```json fern.config.json
{
  "organization": "fern",
  "version": "0.0.247"
}
```

## Consistent version

The `"version"` property is used to pin a specific version of the compiler to
your repo. This ensures that your builds are consistent and reproducible.

You can upgrade to the latest version of the compiler using the Fern CLI:

```
fern upgrade
```

## Organization

The `"organization"` property should be your name or company. This is sometimes used for default SDK coordinates.
