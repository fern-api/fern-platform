We built the Fern Definition because the OpenAPI Specification can be difficult to use. Here's how we're different.

<Callout intent="info">
Despite being a different format for describing APIs, **you are never locked in to using the Fern Definition.** It's easy and free to convert a Fern Definition to an OpenAPI spec.
</Callout>

**TL;DR: The Fern Definition differs from the OpenAPI spec in these areas:**

- [Simplicity](#simplicity)
  - [Example: Map](#example-map)
  - [Example: Discriminated union](#example-discriminated-union)
- [New features in Definition](#new-features-in-definition)
- [Quality of code generation](#quality-of-code-generation)
- [Focus on server-side API development](#focus-on-server-side-api-development)
- [Change management](#change-management)
- [Cloud-based code generation and publishing](#cloud-based-code-generation-and-publishing)

## Simplicity

The Fern Definition was built to be **easy to read and write.** Here are some
examples.

### Example: Map

Here's how you'd define a simple string-to-string dictionary in a Fern Definition:

```yaml Fern example
map<string, string>
```

In OpenAPI:

```json OpenAPI example
type: object
additionalProperties:
  type: string
```

### Example: Discriminated union

Here's how you might define an `Animal` union type in a Fern Definition:

```yaml Fern example
Animal:
  discriminant: pet_type
  union:
    dog: Dog
    cat: Cat

Dog:
  properties:
    breed: DogBreed

DogBreed:
  enum:
    - Dingo
    - Husky
    - Retriever
    - Shepherd

Cat:
  properties:
    hunts: boolean
```

In an OpenAPI spec:

```json OpenAPI example
Animal:
  oneOf:
  - "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Cat"
  - "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Dog"
  discriminator:
    propertyName: pet_type
BaseAnimal:
  type: object
  required:
  - pet_type
  properties:
    pet_type:
      type: string
  discriminator:
    propertyName: pet_type
Dog:
  allOf:
  - "$ref": "#/components/schemas/BaseAnimal"
  - type: object
    properties:
      bark:
        type: boolean
      breed:
        type: string
        enum:
        - Dingo
        - Husky
        - Retriever
        - Shepherd
Cat:
  allOf:
  - "$ref": "#/components/schemas/BaseAnimal"
  - type: object
    properties:
      hunts:
        type: boolean
```

## New features in Definition

As we continue to build Fern, our ability to control the format is invaluable.
For example, we're adding support for asynchronous / bi-directional protocols
(e.g., websockets) which is not possible in OpenAPI.

## Quality of code generation

We built Fern from first principles to ensure that **we always generate
idimoatic code.** There are a number of [footguns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun) in OpenAPI: if you use them,
it's impossible to generate high-quality code. Here are examples:

- Using inline (anonymous) types in an OpenAPI spec makes it impossible to generate idiomatic
  code, as most languages do not support anonymous type declarations.
- It's easy to define non-discriminated unions in OpenAPI, which makes for
  tricky-to-use SDKs. In many languages, it's difficult or impossible to
  deserialize non-discriminated unions correctly.
- Common errors cannot be reused in OpenAPI.
  This results in duplicative generated code that doesn't feel handwritten.
- OpenAPI's `anyOf` concept is impossible to represent in most programming
  languages in sub-exponential time.

Pitfalls like these are why it's common for OpenAPI-generated code to
[not compile](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%22doesn%27t+compile%22).

Beyond the format, we've built Fern based on best practices in compiling. This includes:

- **Semantic validation** (e.g., disallowing references to types that haven't been defined)
- **Building the compiler to be modular,** as we have multiple independent outputs
  (e.g., TypeScript SDK, Postman collection).
- **Producing an intermediate representation** so that different generators don't
  have to implement duplicative logic. Beyond saving time, this reduces errors and
  increases consistency among outputs.
- **Using AST representations,** rather than templates, to enable more complex and
  idiomatic code generation.

## Focus on server-side API development

OpenAPI is focused primarily on documentation and SDK generation and is not very
helpful for backend API development. In comparison, we've focused heavily on
server-side integration, as that's where most of the API development process
occurs! In particular, we:

- **Auto-generate the types** (e.g., Pydantic models for FastAPI)
- **Auto-generate the networking logic** (e.g., FastAPI routes)
- **Auto-generate exceptions** that you can throw. Fern handles converting to the
  correct HTTP status code.
- **Auto-generate server interfaces** for you to implement your business logic.
  This ensures you implement your API correctly. For example, if you return the
  wrong type for an endpoint, you'll get a compile error.

All server code that Fern generates is intended to live in a segmented
`generated/` directory on your backend, which you can import into your code.
This directory can be checked into git and can easily be regenerated.
In comparison, the OpenAPI generators output _server stubs_, which
overwrite your server implementation (see [this issue](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/426)
that's been open since 2018).

## Change management

An important difference between Fern and OpenAPI is our versioning
and change management strategy.

With OpenAPI, you're beholden to their infamous [feature matrices](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java#schema-support-feature); if you want to use a feature, you first need to ensure that all your generators support it.

In comparison, we've built a custom migration framework for our intermediate
representation so that most new features are implicitly supported by older
generators. And when a migration isn't possible, you'll get a clear error from
our compiler of how you can remediate.

## Cloud-based code generation and publishing

Fern runs your code generation in the cloud by default. This improves reliability as we
run the generators in consistent, containerized environments. You run [`fern generate`](cli-reference.mdx),
and _it just works_. You don't need Java installed on your computer to
generate a Java SDK.

Fern handles publishing too. We don't just spit out a bunch of code and say,
"good luck." Fern can publish directly to registries (e.g., npm, Maven) and to
GitHub repos.
