We do our absolute best to avoid breaking changes in our API.
However, sometimes we need to make changes to our API that
will break existing clients. Here's how we recommend thinking
about breaking changes from us:

1. Endpoints marked as `Incubating` are subject to breaking changes without notice.
2. Endpoints marked as `Available` or `Deprecated` are generally not
   subject to breaking changes, only being done in rare cases
   when no other options exist.
3. Any breaking changes that we do make will be clearly
   documented in the Breaking Changes page in our API documentation along with
   a date, so there is always a historical record.
4. We try to notify you of breaking changes as early as possible.
   We do this by sending an email to a breaking changes email list we keep.
   If you would like to be added to this list, please email
   [support@joincandidhealth.com](mailto:support@joincandidhealth.com).

### What is a breaking change

We consider a break any change that meets one of the two following criteria:

- A schema change to a request shape that leads to a previously valid client
  request shape becoming invalid.
- A schema change to a response shape that leads to a previously valid client
  response parser becoming invalid.

Here are some examples of changes that we consider **non-breaking**:

- Adding a new field to an existing response shape
- Making a required field on a request shape optional
- Removing an optional field on a response shape

Here are some examples of changes that we consider **breaking**:

- Removing a required field on a response shape
- Changing the data type of a field
