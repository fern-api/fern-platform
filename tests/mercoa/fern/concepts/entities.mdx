Create and verify your customers

[API Reference](/api-reference/entity)

Before your customers can start using Mercoa, they need to be added as an `Entity`. Entities are the businesses that use Mercoa to pay and get paid.

For every invoice that needs to be paid, there are at least two entities involved:

- `payer`
- `vendor`

## Creating an Entity

You can create an entity on the Mercoa [Admin UI](https://mercoa.com/dashboard/entities) or via [API](/api-reference/entity/create-entity).

You will need to create an entity for each of your customers that will use Mercoa, and verify them before they can start paying bills.

- If you are using the Mercoa iframe, vendor entities will be created automatically.
- If you are using the API, you will need to create the vendor entities as well. Vendor entities **do not** need to be verified before they can receive payments.

See [this guide](/guides/vendors) for more details on vendors.

## Know Your Customer Verification

Banking regulations require that financial institutions perform a “Know Your Customer” (KYC) process to verify an individual or business identity before enabling certain capabilities.
All Mercoa accounts are also checked against OFAC and sanctions lists to ensure they are not forbidden from conducting business in the United States.
