Funding sources and disbursement methods.

[API Reference](/api-reference/entity/payment-method/create-payment-method)

Payment Methods are used as funding sources and disbursement for payments in Mercoa. Some payment methods can only be used as a funding source, others can only be used as a disbursement, and many can be used for both.

The following table shows the available payment methods and their capabilities.

| Payment Method                | Funding Source | Disbursement Method | Available |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| [Bank Account](#bank-account) | Yes            | Yes                 | Yes       |

## Bank Account

Bank Accounts can be considered the default payment method in Mercoa. They can be used as a funding source and disbursement method.

### Create a Bank Account

To create a bank account via API, you need to provide the following information:

- Bank Name
- Account Number
- Routing Number
- Account Type (Checking or Savings)

You can use the [bank lookup endpoint](/api-reference/bank-lookup/find-bank-account) to get the bank name from the routing number.

  You can also use the Mercoa admin dashboard to add a bank account, or your customer can add a bank account directly
  using the iFrame.

### Using a Bank Account as a Funding Source

To use a bank account as a funding source, you need to prove ownership of the account. This is done by depositing a small amount of money into the account and verifying that the amount matches the amount deposited.
This is done by calling the [Initiate Micro Deposit](/api-reference/payment-method/initiate-micro-deposits) endpoint and then the [Verify Micro Deposit](/api-reference/payment-method/complete-micro-deposits) endpoint with the appropriate amounts.

  You can also use the Mercoa admin dashboard or iFrame to initiate and verify micro deposits.

### Using a Bank Account as a Disbursement Method

Bank accounts do not need to be verified to be used as a disbursement method.
