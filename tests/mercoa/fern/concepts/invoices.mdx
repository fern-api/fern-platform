# Lifecycle of an invoice

The invoice lifecycle is as follows:

![Invoice Lifecycle](https://i.ibb.co/n7RckML/invoice-lifecycle.png)

This guide will go through the minimum required data to get an invoice through the complete lifecycle.
If you are using the [Mercoa iframe](/ui-quick-start), all these steps are automatically handled for you.

# 1. Creating a Draft

If an invoice is [created](/api-reference/invoice/create-invoice) and saved as draft, or if it comes in through the [email inbox](/guides/email-inbox) it will be in the `DRAFT` state.

## What needs to be set to get in this state?

### PayerId

The payer is the [entity](/concepts/entities) that is paying the invoice.

```ts
// Example
{
  status: 'DRAFT',
  payerId: 'ent_123456',
}
```

All other information is optional. An invoice can be in the `DRAFT` while being partially updated with information until it has all the requirements to get into the `NEW` state.

# 2. Getting ready for approval

An invoice that has all information required to be approved can be moved to the `NEW` state.

## What needs to be set to get in this state?

### Vendor ID

The vendor is the [Entity](/entities) that is receiving the payment for the invoice. The vendor needs to be [created](/api-reference/entity/create-entity)
and have a valid profile.

### Amount and Currency

The `amount` is the total amount of the invoice. This is the amount that will be paid to the vendor. The `currency` is the currency that the invoice is in, e.g. `USD`.

### Due Date

The `dueDate` is the date that the invoice is due.

```ts
// Example
{
  status: 'NEW',
  payerId: 'ent_123456',
  vendorId: 'ent_987654',
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'USD',
  dueDate: '2021-01-15'
}
```

<Callout intent="info">
  Once an invoice is in the NEW state, the amount, currency, dueDate, payerId and vendorId **cannot** be changed.
</Callout>

# 3. Getting approvals

If the entity has an [approval policy](/api-reference/entity/approval-policy/create-an-approval-policy) set, the invoice will need to be approved by all relevant parties to move to the `APPROVED` state.

<Callout intent="info">
  If the entity does *NOT* have an [approval policy](/api-reference/entity/create-approval-policy) set, the invoice will
  automatically move into the APPROVED state and will not be in the NEW state.
</Callout>

<br />

When the invoice is created, a snapshot of the approval policy will be saved to the invoice. This means that any changes to the policy in the future will not reflect on previously created invoices.
A list of `approvers` will be created on the invoice. An `approver` can be an individual [entity user](/api-reference/entity/user/get-all-entity-users) or a list of roles.

```ts
// Example Approvers list on an invoice
{
  ...
  approvers: [{
    roles: ['approver', 'controller'],
    action: 'NONE'
  },{
    userId: 'user_123456',
    roles: ['approver', 'controller'],
    action: 'NONE'
  }]
}
```

If an `approver` is a specific user, only that user can fill that approval. Otherwise, any user with an appropriate role can fill an approval.

In the example above, any user with the role `approver` or `controller` can approver as the first approver, but only `user_123456` can be the second approver.

A user can only fill one approval, and currently approver order is not enforced.

If only a role is provided, you can update the approvers list by providing a `userId` for a user that is in the appropriate role. Once the `userId` is set, only that user can approve the invoice, and it cannot be changed.

To add an approval to the invoice, use the [approve](/api-reference/invoice/approval/approve-invoice) endpoint. You can pass in an optional `text` field if the user wants to add a comment with their approval.

Once all approvals are complete, the invoice will automatically move to the `APPROVED` status, there is no need to update the invoice.

<Callout intent="info">
  Approvals and Rejections create a [comment](/api-reference/invoice/comment/add-a-comment) on the invoice. You can use
  this to show a list of comments and approvals, as the comments will have the approver details as part of the response.
</Callout>

# 6. Scheduling the payment

Once all approvers have been set, you can schedule the payment.

## What needs to be set to get in this state?

### paymentSourceId

This is the [payment method](/api-reference/entity/payment-method) for the payer (funding source)

### paymentDestinationId

This is the [payment method](/api-reference/entity/payment-method) for the vendor (disbursement method)

### Deduction Date

This is the date funds will be triggered to moved

```ts
// Example
{
  status: 'SCHEDULED',
  payerId: 'ent_123456',
  vendorId: 'ent_987654',
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'USD',
  dueDate: '2021-01-15'
  deductionDate: '2021-01-13'
  paymentSourceId: 'pm_123456',
  paymentDestinationId: 'pm_987654'
}
```

# 5. Pending

On the `deductionDate`, at or before 1PM EST, the payment will be triggered and the invoice will be in the `PENDING` state. This means that the invoice amount will be deducted from the payer's account and sent to the vendor.

No action is required, this is an automatic function.

# 6. Paid

When the invoice amount is received by the vendor, the invoice will be set to the `PAID` state.

<Callout intent="info">
  If you are using custom payment rails, you are responsible for moving the invoice into this state once the funds have
  settled.
</Callout>
