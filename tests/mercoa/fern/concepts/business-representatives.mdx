## About business representatives

A business representative is someone with financial ownership or significant control over a business entity. In order to meet federal regulations, Mercoa is required to collect and verify information about these individuals. We have two categories for business representatives:

- Controllers
- Owners

If you’re providing information for a business representative, they must be either a controller or an owner (see below for more information). In some instances, the controller and owner can be the same person.
If this is the case, set both `isController` and `isOwner` to `true`. We allow a maximum of 7 business representatives for a Mercoa account.

<Callout intent="info">
  This only applies to entities set up as businesses. Entities that are set up as individuals will not have a business
  representative.

## Controller

In compliance with regulatory guidelines, we require you to provide information for at least one verified business representative who exercises significant control over the company.
Some examples of business representatives include the CEO, COO, Treasurer, President, Vice President, or Managing Partner.

## Financial ownership

Additionally, we are required to verify all individuals with a ≥25% ownership stake of the company. Ownership information can be provided by creating a representative where `isOwner` = `true` and providing the `ownershipPercentage`. If the representative you’ve created does not own ≥25% of your
company, you can indicate that by making sure `isOwner` = `false` and leaving the ownership percentage field blank.

Below, we’ve consolidated the data requirements for owners and controllers.
