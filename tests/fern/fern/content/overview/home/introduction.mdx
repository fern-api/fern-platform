Fern is an [open source](https://github.com/fern-api/fern) toolkit for building
REST APIs. With Fern, you can generate SDKs, API documentation,
and boilerplate for your backend server.

Fern is **fully compatible with OpenAPI**. You can use your existing OpenAPI
spec to generate code and documentation with Fern. If you're not a fan of
OpenAPI, you can also use Fern's simpler format to define your API.

The magic of Fern is our compiler. We use your API definition to generate useful outputs, like:

- **SDKs.** Client libraries speed up internal development and help
  acquire customers who use your API. Our auto-generated SDKs are **idiomatic**
  and **feel handwritten**.
- **Documentation.** Fern provides first class support for generating documentation,
  ranging from fully featured documentation websites to Postman Collections.
  This allows you to always keep your documentation, API and Postman
  collections in sync with ease.
- **Backend boilerplate.** We automatically generate lots of boilerplate on the server
  side, like Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot. We also add
  compile-time validation that all your endpoints are being served correctly.
