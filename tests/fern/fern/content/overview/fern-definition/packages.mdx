## What is a package?

Every folder in your API definition is a package.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/ # <------ root package
    ├─ api.yml
    ├─ imdb.yml
    └─ persons/ # <-------- nested package
      ├─ director.yml
```

The generated SDK will match the hierarchy of your API definition.

```ts
const client = new Client();

// calling endpoint defined in imdb.yml
client.imdb.getRating("goodwill-hunting");

// calling endpoint defined in persons/director.yml
client.persons.director.get("christopher-nolan");
```

## Package Configuration

Each package can have a special file called `__package__.yml`. Just like any
other definition file, it can contain [imports](imports),
[types](types), [endpoints](endpoints), and [errors](errors).

Endpoints in `__package__.yml` will appear at the root of the package.
For example, the following generated SDK

```ts
const client = new Client();

client.submitRating("goodwill-hunting", 9.5);
```

would have a fern directory

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ __package__.yml # <---
    └─ api.yml
```

that contains the following `__package__.yml`

<CodeBlock title="__package__.yml">
```yaml 
service:
  base-path: ""
  auth: true
  endpoints:
    submitRating:
      method: POST
      path: "/submit-rating/{movieId}"
      path-parameters:
        movieId: string
      request:
        type: double
        docs: Rating of the movie
```
</CodeBlock>

## Namespacing

Each package has its own namespace. This means you can reuse type names and
error names across packages.

This is useful when versioning your APIs. For example, when you want to
increment your API version you can just copy the existing API
to a new package and start making changes. If the new API version reuses
certain types or errors, that's okay because the two APIs live in different
packagess.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ api.yml
    └─ imdb/
        └─ v1/
          └─ movie.yml # type names can overlap with v2/movie.yml
        └─ v2/
          └─ movie.yml
```
