Every Fern Docs web site has a special file called `docs.yml`, which includes all the docs-wide configuration.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
title: Fern | Docs
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - page: Authentication
        path: ./auth.mdx
  - api: API Reference

  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support

### Title

The `<title>` tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The title is required. The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). [Read more.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp)

### Navigation

The navigation organizes your documentation in the nav bar. Each section has a title and a list of contents. Contents contain a page name and a file path. The supported file types are `.md` or `.mdx`.

Let's look at a basic navigation configuration. Here we have two sections, the first is called `Introduction` that has a single page `My Page` and the second is API Reference.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdxx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

### Tabs

Within the navigation you can add `tabs`. Tabs are used to group content together. Let's add a new tab so that we can include `Help Center` content in addition to our API Reference. Each tab has a `title` and `icon`. [Browse the icons available](https://fontawesome.com/search) from FontAwesome.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
     contents: 
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdxx
        - api: API Reference   
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdxx
```
</CodeBlock>

### Versions

If you have multiple versions of your documentation, you can introduce a dropdown version selector by specifying the versions and their availability.

To add a version, specify the `display-name` which be visible to users and `path` which is a file that must be in a folder called `versions`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
versions: 
  - display-name: v1.0
      path: v1-0.yml # has to be in a `versions` folder
  - display-name: v1.1
      path: v1-1.yml
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-0.yml">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdxx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-1.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
     contents: 
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdxx
        - api: API Reference   
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdxx
```
</CodeBlock>

## API Reference

A key benefit of using Fern Docs is that you get your API Reference with just one line. Add `- api: API Reference` and Fern will take care of the rest! You'll see your endpoints, types, and errors populated from your API definition automatically.

## Navigation Bar

Having easy-to-use navigation is important for any documentation web site. In `navbar-links`, you may specify a list of links.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```
</CodeBlock>

### Link type

A link can be `primary` or `secondary`. Primary links are designed to stand out and indicate that they are clickable with an arrow `>`. You may have one primary link.

### Link text

A link has text which is displayed to the user.

### Link URL

A link has a URL which a user is directed to. By default, URLs open in a new browser tab.

<Callout intent="tip">
Tip: you may want to use a trackable link for the URLs, such as [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters).
</Callout>

## Colors

You may specify a primary accent color using the [Hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp). The primary accent color is used in many places, including:

- to indicate the page a user is on within the navbar
- the background of a primary link button
- to underline hyperlinks
- the next and previous page navigation buttons

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
```
</CodeBlock>

## Logo

Defines parameters for the website's logo display.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=logo
```
</CodeBlock>

### Path

`path` specifies the image file location. Supported logo file types include `.png` and `.svg`.

### Height

`height` sets the logo's height in pixels.

### Href

`href` provides a hyperlink for the logo, often used 
to point to the website homepage.

## Favicon

Specifies the path to a favicon image, which is typically displayed in a 
browser tab or bookmark. This small but crucial customization enhances user experience 
by allowing the website to have a unique and recognizable icon. 
Supported file types are `.png` and `.ico`.
