                Typically, providers submitting claims to Candid are using ICD-10
                diagnosis codes. If you are using ICD-10 codes, the primary
                diagnosis code listed on the claim should use the ABK code_type.
                If more than one diagnosis is being submitted on a claim, please
                use ABF for the rest of the listed diagnoses. If you are using
                ICD-9 diagnosis codes, use BK and BF for the principal and
                following diagnosis code(s) respectively.
