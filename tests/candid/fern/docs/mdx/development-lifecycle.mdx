Endpoints in our API live in one of three states: incubating, available, and deprecated.

- **Incubating**: Endpoints in this state can be used, but proceed with caution. We are still working on them, and
  they may change or break at any time.
- **Available**: Endpoints in this state are available and reliable to use. We actively provide support for them, so
  please do let us know if anything is not working as expected!
- **Deprecated**: Endpoints in this state are available to use, however we generally will have a recommendation of
  something better to use (maybe a new version or a different endpoint). We provide support for these on a case-by-case
  basis, sometimes asking you to upgrade your client to resolve any issues.

Our endpoint documentation will specify if the endpoint is incubating or deprecated. Otherwise, you can safely assume
that it is available.
