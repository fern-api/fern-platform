We strive to make our API as easy to use as possible.

## Design Principles

When we make decisions about how to design our API, we consider
the following:

1. We try to use the same APIs internally that you use. This allows us to catch errors early and to make sure that our API is easy to use.

2. We try to make our API simple. We want to make sure that you can get up and running quickly. We also want to make sure that you don't have to write a lot of code to use our API.
