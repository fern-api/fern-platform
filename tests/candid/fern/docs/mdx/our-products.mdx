### Encounters

Candid's primary entry point for submitting encounter information is the [Encounters](../api-reference/encounters) endpoint. Candid uses
the information sent to this endpoint to submit claims.

### Eligibility

Candid's [Eligibility](https://app.joincandidhealth.com/docs#tag/Eligibility) endpoint can be used to run real-time
eligibility checks on patients to confirm active medical coverage and to understand the patient's benefits (co-pays, deductibles, etc).

### Exports

Candid's [Exports](https://app.joincandidhealth.com/docs#tag/Exports) endpoints are used to programmatically download CSV
exports of changes to a claim's status and associated metadata (e.g., service line amounts, patient and subscriber info, provider info).

### Tasks

Candid's [Tasks](../api-reference/tasks) endpoint can be used to embed Candid's Tasks in another system, like your integrated
EMR partner. Find information about the legacy Tasks implementation [here](https://app.joincandidhealth.com/docs#tag/Tasks).

### Example workflow using Candid's products

1. When a patient signs up or schedules an appointment, [Eligibility](https://app.joincandidhealth.com/docs#tag/Eligibility) is used to run a real-time eligibility check to confirm the patient's medical coverage.
2. A day before the patient's appointment, [Eligibility](https://app.joincandidhealth.com/docs#tag/Eligibility) is used again to re-confirm the patient's coverage. It may have lapsed since they scheduled the appointment.
3. After visit has been completed, an [Encounter](../api-reference/encounters) is submitted to Candid. This either happens in real-time immediately when the visit is completed and/or signed, or in a batch job at the end of the day.
4. [Exports](https://app.joincandidhealth.com/docs#tag/Exports) are downloaded and processed daily. Patient payments are sent to collect the balance owed on finalized adjudicated claims based on this data.
5. [Tasks](../api-reference/tasks) are synchronized with your system if you are not working them directly in the Candid app.
