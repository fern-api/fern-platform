# Superagent Cloud Platform

The Superagent Cloud Platform is a state-of-the-art infrastructure specifically designed to run agents in a fast and performant way. 
It leverages cutting-edge techniques such as Server-Sent Events (SSE), concurrency, and workflow orchestration to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.

At its core, the platform utilizes some of the best and most reliable frameworks in the industry. 
FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs is used for its speed and ease of use. 
Prefect, a new workflow management system, is used for orchestrating the workflows and managing tasks. 
Lastly, Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions, is used for deployment of the Superagent UI.

With this combination of advanced techniques and robust frameworks, the Superagent Cloud Platform provides a reliable and efficient environment for running and managing agents.
