description: Learn about how to enable analytics collection in Segment for a customer's docs site
---

<Steps>

  ### Step 1: Navigate to Segment
  
  Go to https://app.segment.com/buildwithfern/overview
  
  ### Step 2: Connect Requested Analytics Destinations
  
  Customers may request analytics in one or multiple destinations. You'll need to connect each one to the existing source (https://app.segment.com/buildwithfern/sources/build_with_fern/overview). Example destinations are Posthog, Google Analytics, and Hubspot
  
  ### Step 3: Configure Destinations
  Each destination may require some configuration. 
  
  For Posthog:
  
    Background: we collect our own analytics in Posthog based on all buildwithfern docs sites in addition to sending data to our customers' posthog instances. To enable this, we use Segment destination functions to route events to the customer's instance.
    
    Step 0: Get the customer's Posthog write key and docs domain (eg https://dev.hume.ai/intro)
    
    Step 1: Navigate to the 'Send Pageviews to Posthog' function (https://app.segment.com/buildwithfern/functions/catalog/ifnd_6642809e38542e19d398034e/edit/code)
    
    Step 2: Add a new entry to DESTINATION_MAP with k:v of docs_domain:posthog_write_key. For example if I want to send events on 'blake.docs.buildwithfern.com' to the Posthog instance with writekey 'abcdefg', I add 'blake.docs.buildwithfern.com': 'abcdefg' to the DESTINATION_MAP
    
    Step 3: Test! Use the built-in test function to grab sample events and run the updated function on them. You should get an 'Output: Success' message if everything goes smoothly. Try to test with at least 1 example from the new customer's site and 1 from a different docs site. 
    
    Step 4: Save and Deploy. Once you deploy your changes will go live and the events should start populating in the customer's posthog instance.
</Steps>

## Additional configs

- **whitelabeled**: This will remove the Fern branding from the docs site.
- **api-scrolling-disabled**: This will disable the single-page API scrolling feature.
- **seo-disabled**: This will disable the site from being indexed by search engine crawlers.
