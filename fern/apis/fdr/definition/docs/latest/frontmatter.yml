  Layout:
    enum:
      - value: guide
        docs: Guides are typically long-form content, and are designed for readability.
      - value: overview
        docs: |
          Overview pages are typically meant to be a landing page for a section of the documentation.
          These pages are 50% wider than guide pages, but the table of contents is still visible.
      - value: reference
        docs: |
          Reference pages are best used for API docs or other material that is meant to have a right-hand column.
          This layout is not recommended for long-form content because they are 2x the width of guide pages and can be difficult to read.
          Using an <Aside> component is recommended. It will generate a sticky right-hand column for the page, which is useful for code snippets.
          <Aside> component is not available in guides and overview, and will automatically cause the layout to switch to reference.
          Note: Table of contents are always hidden on reference pages.
      - value: page
        docs: |
          The layout used for full-width pages. This is useful for landing pages or other custom layouts.
          Both the navigation sidebar and the table of contents are hidden.
          The content will take up the full width of the page-width container, which is set by docs.yml.
      - value: custom
        docs: |
          This layout takes over 100% of the viewport width, below the header.
          Unlike PageLayout, the content will not be constrained to the page-width container, and does not render any padding.
