      The information described here is a combination of user-defined information
      (i.e. specified in the generators.yml), and dynamically generated information
      that comes from each generator (i.e. features, requirements, and more).

      snippetsAreOptional:
        docs: |
          If true, the feature block should be rendered even if we don't receive a snippet for it.
          This is useful for features that are always supported, but might not require a snippet
          to explain.
        type: boolean

  LanguageInfo:
    docs: |
      The language and its associated publish information (if any).

      This is used to generate badges, the installation guide, and determine what language to
      use when surrounding the snippets in a code block.
