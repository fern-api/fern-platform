Here you'll find information about the various endpoints available to you,\nas well as the parameters and responses that they accept and return.\n\nWe will be exposing more and more of our APIs over time as they stabilize. If there is some action you can perform\nvia the UI that you wish you could perform via API, please let us know and we can expose it here in an unstable state.\n\n### API Stability\n\nSome of the APIs documented within are undergoing active development. Use the \n<strong style={{ backgroundColor: \"#4caf50\", color: \"white\", padding: 4, borderRadius: 4 }}>Stable</strong>\nand \n<strong style={{ backgroundColor: \"#ffc107\", color: \"white\", padding: 4, borderRadius: 4 }}>Unstable</strong>\ntags to differentiate between those that are stable and those that are not.\n\n### Base URLs\n\nSome endpoints are hosted separately from the main Vellum API and therefore have a different base url. If this is\nthe case, they will say so in their description.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all endpoints use `https://api.vellum.ai` as their base URL.\n\n### Official API Clients:\n\nVellum maintains official API clients for Python and Node/Typescript. We recommend using these clients to interact\nwith all stable endpoints. You can find them here:\n\n<Cards center>\n    <Card title=\"Python\" href=\"https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-client-python\" />\n    <Card title=\"Node/Typescript\" href=\"https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-client-node\" />\n</Cards>\n"

Prompt templates contain \nthe fixed parts of a prompt with placeholders for the parts that \nmight change from run to run. When you use a prompt template, \nyou pass in specific values for the placeholders to create \nthe final prompt that‚Äôs sent to the LLM.\n\nVellum‚Äôs Prompt Syntax supports dynamically constructed \nprompts via [jinja templating](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/) \nand what we call ‚Äúblocks.‚Äù\n\n## Jinja Templating\n\nJinja is a powerful templating syntax useful for dynamic content.\nMost commonly, you‚Äôll use it to reference Prompt Variables. \nBelow are the most common things you‚Äôre likely to want to do, \nbut you can find jinja‚Äôs complete documentation \n[here](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/).\n\n### Variables\nReference variables using double-curly-brackets. For example,\n\n<CodeBlock title=\"Reference Variables\">\n```\nYou are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant.\n```\n</CodeBlock>\n\n<Callout intent=\"warning\">\n  Note that all variables are treated as strings!\n</Callout>\n\n### Conditionals\n\nPerform conditional logic based on your input variables using if/else statements\n\n<CodeBlock title=\"Conditional Example\">\n```\nYou are a {{ personality_type }} AI assistant.\n{% if personality_type == \"rude\" %}\nYou end every message with a frowning emoji.\n{% else %}\nYou end every message with a smiling emoji.\n{% endif %}\n```\n</CodeBlock>\n\n### Comments\n\nYou can use jinja to leave comments in your prompt that don‚Äôt use up any \ntokens when compiled and sent to the LLM. For example,\n\n<CodeBlock title=\"Comment Example\">\n```\n{# This is a comment #}\nHello, world!\n```\n</CodeBlock>\n"
